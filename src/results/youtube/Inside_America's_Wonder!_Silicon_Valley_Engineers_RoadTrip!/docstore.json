Size of whom? of this Great Canyon Its not that big bro! I'm serious, I read about it It's like 2000 sq miles Can you believe it? And not just this The temperature here, like somewhere is snow and somewhere there isn't because temperature ranges to upto 25 degrees here, up and down. One place to another It's not that big bro 2000 sq miles Can you believe it! No Its really epic! I didn't knew this much Yes It's like truly maginificant feeling But Rhode island is very beautiful This can be compared with Jordan's petra It's not less than that Amazing You made of Petra right? Yes I made There are so many amazing view points I mean its so big! See it 2000 sq miles and it's so big And can you believe? Even after all that This is not World's deepest cave More deepest than this exists but this is the biggest one. Where they exists?? Somewhere I think Will have to check that Bro, World's deepest cave exists in Georgia Athlanta? In Georgia country There it is even more deeper than 2000 sq miles This is less than 2000 Sorry, it is more in Georgia and lesser here How many national parks you've been to? This is my 2nd We went with you to Reineer When you were doing internship in Seattle in Meta That time It gets mixed up Wow Not visible because of that cloud Reflection of sun is coming there So cool. The moon looks so good and we staying in Grand canyon We're staying inside in this lodge So boys have checked in Yes!!! Room is ordinary Who am I sucking tonight So, who will sleep with each other? Don't put this in video I don't have any issue, I can sleep anywhere yeah, so size matters So bigger size with smaller size Guys, today was so much fun we had so much fun Let's come to reality from this hotel room because as engineers and common people We're surrounded by cyber security threats everywhere Whether it is companies in Vegas like MGM where they had loss of $100million because of one cyber security attack And similar is happening in Roku now All their data is leaked. So, to stay safe from these attacks. A simple hack you can use is by using a VPN Because with VPN, all of your data in your device and internet becomes encrypted. And you become anonymous No one can tell from which country you're And this simple hack can keep you secure in the world of internet That's why I use my favourite VPN called SurfShark because firstly, it allows me to use on unlimited devices. My android phones, my laptops, ipads everything Plus it allows me to have less subscriptions because because peacock, HBO, netflix eevrything asks for subscription With SurfShark, I can change country to India Get the store unblocked Plus to get youtube premium for 100rs a month almost which is India's pricing So, what are you waiting for guys So, full moon guys and you can see so many stars I see the sky full of stars I think it won't come in phone but it is so epic. I see the sky full of stars We woke at 6am to see the sunrise and again cloudy weather And its freezing yeah its freezing So I got burrito and a cup of hot milk. Hot milk? yeah I know hot milk is healthier. So, that's why Coffee has zero calories. yeah but milk will fill you up for the hike Caffeine is not like good for you Its better than cocaine When you visit cities then you realize that national parks are most b'ful here Yeah My goal is to visit all before 30. Till now, how much you've reached? 5-6 Show your passport to me also It doesn't have old stamps now, This is new one Really? The ones I have visited are not in it How many national parks are there in US? Like, there's a passport for it to keep track 50 something Oh wow So, you can put all the stickers there And I think this should be one of the top 10 atleast This is their visitors centre.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3435, "end_char_idx": 7641, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36b766bc-14d7-492d-89f0-41ff3b2ee595": {"__data__": {"id_": "36b766bc-14d7-492d-89f0-41ff3b2ee595", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/youtube/Inside_America's_Wonder!_Silicon_Valley_Engineers_RoadTrip!.txt", "file_name": "Inside_America's_Wonder!_Silicon_Valley_Engineers_RoadTrip!.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 12685, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "af201da1-6300-423b-ac5a-e60ff2212286", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/youtube/Inside_America's_Wonder!_Silicon_Valley_Engineers_RoadTrip!.txt", "file_name": "Inside_America's_Wonder!_Silicon_Valley_Engineers_RoadTrip!.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 12685, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-11"}, "hash": "6077691816bef0435241f290abe6465d45f5c35e819472002837c41b4acb5cdd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "04e432f9-a45c-4478-8178-f86b2c120a51", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/youtube/Inside_America's_Wonder!_Silicon_Valley_Engineers_RoadTrip!.txt", "file_name": "Inside_America's_Wonder!_Silicon_Valley_Engineers_RoadTrip!.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 12685, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-11"}, "hash": "96ad6023054eae0ff3a95be4310c02184a9e11458e40cdc89dcb29229a71c4cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3e21e3e0-58dc-44fe-90b8-7e8377a68f7f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2b20baf8ce21cc46520442cc61c42fe9c5a8b635eb9c32645adfbb2c8842bac7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Hot milk? yeah I know hot milk is healthier.

There's a show as well This is how we get stamped Let's do the stamp Stamp on passport That's free so, first stamp is in And, here we go Oh yeah They change it everyday mar' 23 Oh really! yeah yeah It's like a country's stamp. From visitor centre we got to know the best hike trail. So we have decided to go to South so, that is around 4 hours And views for all are same but this is most popular one. And here are many vehicles of US govt. also And they have a different license plate So, we're taking this bus for the hiking trail It's not this one? See there's written Kaibab route So, hiking begins guys And majority people who die here You know how it happens I asked them, How many times accidents happen? Peak time is august People literally like be on this and then they're relaxing and this is fall off Oh, Be careful..Don't be on this edge And many accidents happen with the selfie stick too Like people have tripod and they get lost in vlogging In August month here, We were talking before They said \"In august, 5 helicopters were actually 5 helicopters came in august month, You know that right? They had to fly them out straight to the hospital If you get bitten by the snake Then you have to pay $10k for that Antitode More like $30k But I mean, that's healthcare in the US for you They have the antitode, a lot of countries don't have that Yeah So, you'll get the antitode but it's like $30k Helicopter's cost and ambulance cost is $800 one way and lot of costs. If you get bitten by a snake, so be careful very careful Have to be very careful And what cons it has, please tell those also Audience must know this Most are rattle snakes and here is that also Let me just tie my laces Let me tie my laces. Here is rattle snakes and scorpions also. There's a lot here And just in case, Snake bites you then what we'll do Then helicopter will come and take me It is really epic hike The view is very nice. So amazing But have to be careful walking Need to be very careful I also read that the height is so big that half of the people get heart attack So they die in between and then they land. And remember guys, this is a desert At the end of the day, you have to drink lots of water Everywhere check points will come, So I have two bottles with me And hike is of 4 hours Like yeah, Oh my god! And once again, it is unbelievable to imagine that Like this walk is so long that it is so long that it is even longer than a state of US Longer than Rhode Island Bigger than Rhode Island in sq m area as well as in length. Can you believe it too? yeah, that's crazy And those who are curious that how it was formed It was formed through colorado river It was all water and then dried up and led to the formation of the Grand canyon Like going is so easier because you're on the right side. But while coming back, people were stopping for us Because when people walk on the left side, it is very scary. Coming back is gonna be scarier, we're gonna be on the edge. If you slip, you're done Yeah basically. Here, the weather difference is a lot 25 degrees change up and down. It's a lot of temperature change around the Grand Canyon It's hot now and it was cold up there. Oh gosh! Don't do that On the way back, you can have horses I guess. So this is the Ooha point Wow, we came from all the way top till here.

Don't fall back Don't fall back You're right The view is amazing Oh wow SO, that is end That is end and there is colorado river part. So, next checkpoint guys If you want to hike more From there river is also visible but not worth it, its just mud So, we're just stopping here Till here is 110 sq m elevation So, it'll be very difficult to go up. But if you go down its less elevation which is 900 but its not worth it. They said its not worth it to see the mud and river If you want another one hour down and two hours up. Just got to know that this is also 1100 elevation Too much Wow What a hike! We can get very nice picture here How you feel? We finally did it guys Energy is back Back to earth Line for bus to go home. Totally worth it, It was so much fun Was lot of fun, right? It was so much fun! I think we should just drive Good choice Good choice We're in line, finally its so long Line is so big! Frank brother has gone to touch them. Long line now and then directly food and then next Vegas Great trip to Grand Canyon Vegas is four hours from here. Anyone who comes here, I would say it's really worth it Hike is a bit difficult But if you can do then definitely come Even if you can't still come and try as much as you can. And don't go too down as well. because while going down you don't get to know like how much down we're And then its difficult to come up.
