high demand for this field like I  would say 90% they got internships really yeah   so hello everyone today we have umber here he's  going to explain the industry no one is talking   about because he is part of the semiconductors  industry one of the most Recession Proof industry   in the US right now and batchmates are 90%  in apple nid or AMD right because recession   May software Engineers were not getting calls  he was someone and his friends in electronics   communication LSI semiconductors were getting  the calls so hi Amber can you please introduce   yourself hi so my name is Amber and I'm I'm  finally a student in at Jo Tech and I'm pursuing   electrical and computer engineering so my interest  primar lies in uh physical design or vsi design   which is essentially converting logic into uh  actual tape out ready uh layouts H Tap Out is so Step before TSMC as it gives you a ready fabricated chip you have to send them a design Earlier they used to make designs on a tape Now we have server farms we send .GDSII file Earlier actual disk tapes were used to save the date. we used to read the tapes to fabricate Tape out is getting the Chip out So this is i7 layout, cores are there, we send this image to TSMC and they send this chip out We can put this now directly on Laptops, Phones etc fabrication how you became aess expert back  undergr Electronics so why undergrad electronics   and what experience you had how you got interested  in it I started my bachelor with the mechanical   and uh like in my first year I realized that I'm  really good at electrical like naturally I was   good at electrical engineering and electronics  how did you figure out that uh because all my   friends everyone around me was struggling with  electrical and I got like a straight A oh yeah   and it was like people were like actually failing  it was not even like it was getting PC people were   failing and a lot of people even Studios people  were like at C or B and I was just naturally at   a I didn't find it challenging and I really found  it interesting that uh okay you can solve circus   like this so uh for me that was just like uh one  indicator that okay I'm good at this uh and in   my second year like I was doing this buggy project  right we have that uh in undergrads so uh like for   me it was like uh actually fun to design the logic  like IR all the sensors interfacing them with the   microcontrollers it was actually fun so I was  like you know this is what I want to do I don't   want to do mechanical uh so in my second year  I switched to electronics and in my final year   I like during that placement time right I was uh  interested in software because like all my friends   were in software so uh like everyone was talking  about software and there was a bubble in 2021 that   software jobs were paying a lot tier 2 tier three  College 50 LH package like it was highly bloated   because just Co everyone was hiring right because  everyone was like there's going to be a lot of   demand so uh like I also was like okay everyone's  doing that so let's do this I didn't even know   about vs I didn't even know about 7 industry uh  and then like uh I think arm came to our campus   and I got sh listed for the uh interview like I  didn't even prepare for the test and I cleared   the test so for me that was like an indicator okay  like and that's the first time I got to know that   okay this is actually an industry so then like  I really tried for semi but I didn't get it so   uh I started as a software engineer Samsung  right and then soon after like I left my   software engineering job for an internship uh  at Cadence Cadence Cadence is in chips yeah so   Cadence is an edate company it designs a software  uh but I was in the IP design team of cadence so   we would we would design our own IPS and property  intellectual property intellectual property and   sell it to other company so basically chips  sell correct correct so we make our own chips   and sell it to other companies so uh uh I I  did an internship there then I got converted   and then I worked there for 1 year right so  that was like total 2 years approximately and   uh then like I realized that like I need to move  into uh like uh I would say the core IP design   uh part of this job so like", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4313,

in us and us is like the uh mecca   for semicondctor design so that's why like I  wanted to learn from the best and that's why   made the decision to do my masters of course like  P World key I think 90% of the chips are designed   anyway AB yeah so like when you switch from  Samsung to Cadence was it because of your passion   for chips yeah absolutely I I mean I I was I was  decent at software engineering cuz I I actually   took uh electronics and computer engineering so in  my undergrad I did like I I I did some CS courses   as well and I was decent at programming and I have  been programming since I was like I think uh 15   or 16 oh yeah like since 11th like I had been uh  coding so I was decent at uh programming but then   again like my national uh inclination was towards  Electronics so what was absent in Cadence Cadence   you felt like going to us coming to us so so I  mean I was in uh analog uh design analog layout   so there it's like full custom and it's pretty  like uh it's a it's more like uh it's a very   laborious task I would would say it's like just  uh creating custom chips and I wanted to automate   some part of it and since I knew programming  and so

 largest bank called The Chase Bank and if you see  the transaction history I was charged $12 in the   month when my balance was less than $1,500 and  $15 when I received the incoming wire transfer   from India because of that I decided to switch to  a startup which is recommended by Rice University   and University of Buffalo's website for all  students and even non- students can use it   immediately because it charges you0 nothing when  you receive money from India or anywhere from 95   countries worldwide and you know receiving money  outside of United States charging $15 on other   Banks can add up to hundreds of dollars over years  and you can save up immediately with just one step   and if you switch to it first of all it allows  you to get credit history 1% cash back every time   you use it instantly plus an ability to apply  without social security number when you are in   India you can use it and many students have used  it as proof of Finance when they apply for Visa   by showing money in their adro accounts go ahead  and check out adro because you will get $50 with   my link in description below when you spend  $50 after depositing 500 to your account go   check out right now excellent so let's start with  vsi what does it stand for and little bit about   the industry you are working in sure so vsi stands  for very large scale integration which essentially   means that uh putting about roughly about million  to billion transistors uh on chip right so uh   the task of doing that is essentially called vsi  and it starts from uh the architecture level so   you'll hear about like CPUs and gpus right so  those are architectures which are essentially an   implementation of an Isa Isa Isa is uh instruction  set architecture mhm so for example you know uh   windows 64 right yes uh or Mac OS or you have  uh like arm now also so you'll see like recent   laptops they have arm 64 in them G so arm 64 is  an Isa it's an in instruction set architecture   which essentially a language now someone needs  to write something in that language right so   people who write in those language are called  uh implementation Engineers so or uh different   companies have different implementations for  example arm has its own implementation which it   sells in terms of ips and you won't believe this  almost every company buys arm licensed IPS for   millions of dollars so that's how they've made a  business out of it like like no chip right now is   without arm like if you want low power chips you  need arm in it so IP is have kind of patterns uh   not in uh vsi IPS mean uh chips like uh IP codes  like intellectual property so it'll be like a   block okay that a particular company will Design  and sell it for millions of dollars so for example   for example let's say you're talking about uh  Microsoft they want to make a server chip right so   they need one part which is like low power memory  or low power uh or power management IC right   so they'll essentially buy it from some other  company like maybe infinion or even nxp or TI   and they'll pay like millions of dollars for that  oh yeah so so so this is how it works so designs   are the most valuable asset right absolutely yeah  I think I was watching you know the interview of   irin sasan who is like the C of perplexity  he said that like you know everything is at   the end of the day a rapper for example Nvidia  is a rapper of what TMC is creating design is a I think like shining in this industry that also  shows that's an IP right that's a you know $30,000   gpus absolutely so let's start with the basic  little bit let's start with complete basics for   students watching so let's say we have a CPU and  then we have a GPU so CPU can you share what are   the", "mimetype":

basics for   students watching so let's say we have a CPU and  then we have a GPU so CPU can you share what are   the kind of skills you use what what is happening  right now in your industry so okay so CPU um   essentially it's a very uh like I would say  um consumer Focus market so uh you have like   consumer Focus CPUs for example Intel has its  own an EMD and like whenever we go like we want   to buy the latest like apple has its own M2 and  M4 so uh that's one segment then there's another   segment which is server CPUs so those are like  for heavy load tasks right a CPU is essentially   uh like processing information and data right  so uh any task that you sort of want to perform   on a server it will get queued in the CPU and  for example let's say I I open chat GPD and I   want to uh send a request for an inference so  it'll first queue that request using the CPU   and then send it with the gpus gpus are three  dimensional right right so so uh yeah so you   can say that like it's a brain versus Braun  right braw is like the strength and brain is   like the one that's actually doing the control  of uh or managing the tasks so uh the CPU will   manage all the tasks and schedule it for the brawn  which is the gpus so then gpus will do it uh like   will process the information in parallel right  but CPU cannot do that correct yeah so I think example let me speed it up 4 3 2 1 H so let's say you are painting a big  picture right and if you do with a CPU you will   maybe just paint the nose and like eyes but with  GPU the whole picture whole face can be painted   just at one time a gun gun gun off a paint and  you paint the whole thing all at once whenever   we talk about CPUs and gpus we really need to  talk about Moors law so Moors law in which you   know transistors double every 18 months like look  roughly 2 years but every 18 months transistors   double so the performance doubles as well  absolutely so can you elaborate where does   it come from the history of it and where are we  right now with this law okay so so uh there's this   engineer uh uh at Intel who like who co-founded  Intel called G Mo so he released the paper which   essentially in which he mentioned that or he  just observed that uh given the trend uh every   like the number of chips on number of Trans on a  ship they're doubling roughly 12 months right and   he predicted that in the future this trend will  continue and he predicated that uh theory on the   basis of that uh like engineering effort will  improve over the years so Engineers will keep   on improving this technology and we will see this  uh rise in number of transistors on a chip so it's   also called transistor density or chip density  so uh what is a transistor okay so transistor   is essentially like a switch right uh it's like a  tap so when you uh want to say that okay uh it's   either on or off right so like a tap like it's  either on or off when it's on water flows through   it right and water could be like water essentially  just electrons right but uh what it does is that   for example in memories uh the way it used is that  since we have a binary function 0 or one right   it's on or off so that's where the binary comes  from and data can flow zero or one one so now   now you can store data in terms of Z and one in  a transistor and that's just memory now when you   look at like other parts of logic so for example  uh when you're looking at a like let's say Coss   which is a complimentary Moss so it's it's just  like a logic gate so logic gate what you want is   Boolean algebra right like uh one and one should  be one uh and stuff like that so for that also uh   you can use transistors to drive that logic and  that is a very beautiful uh sort of uh method   in which by which like uh this thing happens  where uh you can actually create logic using these   transistors and and that's how boan algebra was uh  like it came into the picture now the question you   explained Mo pretty well right and transistors", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 9538, "end_char_idx": 13647, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name":

and and that's how boan algebra was uh  like it came into the picture now the question you   explained Mo pretty well right and transistors  double but how do they double can you go in   depth of it with so there are a lot of methods the  most uh like basic method would be essentially to   reduce the size of transistor right a so so that  is the most difficult thing to do uh right now now   especially because if you look at like the number  of like the size of transistors over the years uh   even now like uh there are companies operating at  45 nanom right but now we have reached like 1.8   nanom and 2 Nan n yeah Nom CHS us becoming smaller  abely so but the problem is uh the diameter of   silicon atom is 2 Ang strong2 okay so or I would  say like the diameter of uh silicon atom is2 nanom   uhhuh and now we have reached a gate length of  1.8 nanom right so we are that is the limit right   and there are other limits as well because now  you're at the edge of uh designing or at the edge   of engineering right you've reached the limits so  now people are coming up with new transistors as   well like instead of the traditional transistors  now they're coming up with new transistors like   you have gate all around fed and people are also  looking at Carbon nanot tubes people are looking   at different material as well so you have gallan  nitr and all those things so uh apart from that   like even if you look at like how uh we broke  this limit for example we used to have planer   uh fets or something which is like two dimensional  right and then we broke that into uh fin fet where   we had added a three Third Dimension to the  transistor so finfet finfet uh the name came   because like there's a fin in the transistor  so finfet uh and Technologies like these they   essentially cause musla to uh keep growing or they  continue MOS we make it three dimensionals just   like gpus are also threedimensional so that's how  like MOS definitely applies to gpus as well CPUs   as well all the this is this is what is driving  the uh the growth and performance in CPUs and gpus   like if we didn't create a new transistor with  each generation there won't be any performance   benefits so that's why we see these performance  benefits like if you compare a chip of like let's   say 2024 with a chip of 2017 let's say 7 back  you'll see a dramatic uh change in performance   like and that is partially due to uh the change in  technology as well and why does it happen only in   18 months we understood so far a trans smallest  size possible is 1.8 nanometer so how do we only   be able to do it in 18 months I mean that's just  an observation so it's just a number because uh   that is what the trend was and another like I  would say this is my opinion this is my reason   like my understanding uh which which is that uh if  you look at like how much time it takes to make a   new chip uh the turnaround time is around 2 years  or like 1.5 years yeah it's not like software   where you can like uh quickly make a new product  and ship it right so the whole process like from   uh like the architecture to implementation it  takes uh around 1 and a half to 2 years so that's   why now you explained everything so well now let's  talk about the tech Stacks what do you do in terms   of software Hardware to make it possible to to  possibly Implement Mo's law to possibly double   down the transistors to build Hardware so what  do you do so so", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 12819, "end_char_idx": 16967, "metadata_seperator": "\n",

 talk about the tech Stacks what do you do in terms   of software Hardware to make it possible to to  possibly Implement Mo's law to possibly double   down the transistors to build Hardware so what  do you do so so I would say that there are like   uh four major uh Stacks or four major like uh  areas one is architecture right architecture is   like people who design these CPUs and gpus uh who  create the uh architecture for that then there's   people who translate this architecture into logic  logic means Gates right so that is done through   RT design which is transfer level uh so in that  like you use verilog and system verog these are   programming languages so these are Hardware  so these are called hdls Hardware description   language so uh using them they're like C++ only  so now actually uh they are new things coming up   like system C uh for verification so system C is  essentially similar to C like you have oops you   have all the concepts of uh basic programming it's  just that now you're designing for Hardware right   so that is one thing uh then you have like um if  you go like below that logic uh below that level   then you have uh verification like verification  is now verification usually like solid programming   skills where you need like system ver log C++  C uh depending on which thing you're verifying   right sometimes people need to also learn um  like openg GL bucon uh in order to verify gpus   because because what you're trying to do is you've  designed the logic uh let's say the logic is for a   Shader right of a GPU now you want to verify that  whether that Shader works or not right so you want   to render something what is Shader by the way like  I don't think I have a lot of knowledge it's just   the part of uh like for example you know openg  open okay okay so it's like U um how do I say um   all the games right they run on uh these uh so so  when whenever a GPU renders a game right it needs   a translation language right so these things  open G Von all these things and shaders also   they they help uh sort of translate this code  into yeah basically okay so the these are the   tools basically convert code into functionable  Hardware right that's what it's saying okay so   these are the tools like um H I'll just actually  back up about uh Von vcan is like a programming   language only okay so uh C++ like they just use it  to create like how do I say modules which can be   used in testing but essentially uh you are using  like hdls which diens like system verilog verilog   uh vhdl or system C that's one level then you have  verification which also uses the same languages   and uh cc++ uh and then there's another uh like  level which is uh physical design now physical   design is essentially translating this logic which  you design in RTL uh to uh actual layouts which   will be sent to fabrication units I see so they  will be sent to tsmc so now this this area like I   would say like you would need electrical skills  like uh for example you need to know circuits   you need to be really good at circuits because  there'll be a lot of uh RC ladders like resistance   and capacitance right all those uh we had tanin  and Norton laws so your electrical should be   really good and then like uh once you're good  with the electrical Basics like RCS and of course   you need to know about transistors so uh I  would say mosfets like reading up on mosfets   there's this really nice book by Kang uh which is  called seos I think seos by Kang mosat so moset   is uh metal oxide semiconductor Field Effect  transistor it's like a it's like a transistor   okay so all these things the abbreviation like uh  these things just mean just explain like how the   transistor Works essentially is a switch so using  these switches using 01 we create the world of B   which creates the world of architectures so for  example you have 32bit 64bit what does it mean it   means that the instruction isn't 32 bits so you  need 32", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 16464, "end_char_idx": 20740, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__":

decode the instruction right so more number of  bits you have uh more information you can encode   so that's why like you'll see that 64bit will  have more sort of uh granularity granularity   over the uh sort of os so uh talking about your  physical design you need like electrical skills   you need mosfet transistors and all those things  then another interesting aspect of this is uh that   you need to know like uh I would say coding  so your programming should be good like this   is this is a very sort of uh underscored area  that people don't mention people just say that   like you know for vlsi you need to know electrical  and electronics and people just say that oh you're   from Electronics electrical right but like in our  field in every stage that I mentioned you need   algorithms every field and I'm not just talking  about basic like gry algorithms I'm talking about   graph programming as well oh there there is  graph so so uh all these companies there's   these companies called Eda companies or electronic  design automation okay so these these companies   create the software for our tools so so our tools  the tools that we use right uh there are some   tools in especially in art field like physical  design where you need to like uh draw the shapes   or uh put these cells together right in order  to make make a proper layout so there you need   you need these tools like uh Eda software so these  Eda tools uh they use all these things like graph   partitioning and uh like divide and conquer along  with graphs because now you're looking at let's   say if it's a very simple problem for example if  I say that there are two cells right and you want   to Route them so it's like you can say that it's  like a similar problem to the ones that we had   in DSA like uh there's start Point there's an end  point you go through all possibilities right you   do a recursion and you so it's like that so uh we  need to know those skills because our tools work   on are built on um like algorithms okay so we need  to know algorithms as well and then there's one   coding Pro uh language called tickle and tickle  and pearl so tickle is TCL and then there's Pearl   p r l uh or python python is like the staple like  industry yeah her industry exactly so for example   like if you want to present any data right we need  python we need because in every field like we we   if we can save let's say one% I so I I made  a I would say like so the in last semester I   made a presentation in a packaging course which is  essentially 3D IC packaging so uh my presentation   was that meta was set to buy I think 30,000 uh  h100 gpus from Nvidia okay they have bought the   highest around 200,000 Nvidia gpus they bought  so they they have their future demand and now   also they have bought like 30,000 h100 gpus each  one costs like uh around I think 20,000 I'm not   sure 25,000,000 right so I made a case that uh  I I I calculated the number for Atlanta's power   right like the power in kilowatt hours right how  much uh amount does it like in dollars how much   does it cost and I say that if you can reduce the  power consumption of each h100 GPU by 10% you'll   ENT I think it was uh $ 1.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 19902, "end_char_idx": 23994, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}",

yeah  you can save and that is just from 30,000 GPU now   imagine like server Farms right using uh so many  gpus for for each uh CH GPT inference you need   like so many gpus and so that's why I feel like  this field is pretty solid and like uh there'll   always be a demand to make power efficient chips  which actually save all these companies all these   software companies like meta and Microsoft money  New York City The energy needed is 5 gaw hours   right now that is the amount of energy all the AI  GPU compute from all the companies in the US need   in the next 5 years that is the prediction made as  for the source the newsletter I follow called the   information and that is insane so I think really  need to cut down the cost absolutely that's why   that's why this this feeli like uh there's such  high demand for this field uh like it it is I   agree that it needs a lot of skill uh to enter uh  and like even now like when I uh I I play soccer   so like I I meet some people so they they talking  to me like about the career Affairs and all so uh   they were asking me like how come like you know  uh this field is good like your field is good so   I was explaining to them and they're like how can  we enter this field and he was like a CS major so   uh I was like you know you actually can like there  is there is a big uh skill required to enter the   market but you can say like a CS student with not  much about semiconductor industry knowledge or   vssl vsi VLS vsi vsi okay not much vsi knowledge  how can they enter right so I feel that uh this a   like a positive news for computer science students  they already have the basic skills which is uh   programming and data science so data science is  very big like you need to uh use data science to   actually prove your theories right so if you're  saying that I'm going to save this much power you   need to figure out for example uh let's say you  have billion chips a billion transistor on a chip   right you can't verify each single transistor  that whether this is going to save power or not   so you have to do like some approximations and  that's where data science comes into the picture   so you need data science you need algorithms that  I mentioned that algorithms are a staple of this   industry right so they have those skills another  interesting skill that they already possess is   operating systems right so these are like staple  computer science courses and it's actually nice   because uh if you know operating systems you can  make the jump to uh I would say architecture cuz   it's like just it's linked through this uh so  computer architecture is called like Hardware   software uh code design mhm right because it's  it's a code design of software and Hardware   where you're saying that okay this is how this  is the language in which the software is going   to interact with the hardware so so that's how  uh they can enter computer architecture and if   of course like if they want to move into let's  say logic design or physical design they would   require like uh basic electrical knowledge so  it it doesn't take that much time like maybe a   few months to just know the basics like how do  how does a transistor work uh what's cosos uh   how does logic like uh how a logic gets formed  using", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 23225, "end_char_idx": 27410,

problem for example like you you want to look at   documentation a programmer looks at documentation  all are available like but if you want to find   documentation for ver logs right very log s logs  it's a big challenge absolutely and is I just saw   a why YC backed startup of an 18-year-old who  I'm possibly interviewing Su as well so he's   developing a way in which you just name a verog  file or a cisl file documentation okay yeah so   which is really useful for like you know that's  hardware Engineers people that n and all these uh   chips companies right right right so yeah I mean  U like uh even I think I think most of the stuff   uh I learned I Lear learned through books only so  so like I would just like search for particular   books like let's say system where loog tutorial or  algorithms and then I would just read the entire   book to understand how you code this hardware  and then uh like there's another like there's an   interesting website called HDL bits uhhuh I'm not  sure who designed it but uh you can use that uh so   it's like a it's like a lead code for Hardware  uh HDL bits HDL bits HDL bits yeah Hardware   description language bits so you can use that it's  like it's similar to lead code but for very log so   anyone who wants to enter like uh Hardware design  they can use uh H bits as lead code resources like   are you able to find stack Overflow for you know  these problems you face or you just have to go   through the route of books yeah so there are some  overflow uh like websites I I forgot the name uh   but there are like uh some uh sort of blogs where  people discuss uh like all these problems cuz now   the number is growing right so now there's a  community which is growing out so uh like even   I had this community of uh I think Eda playground  uhhuh so Eda again the same thing right so they   have website called Ed playground where you could  discuss like you know let's say I say that okay I   wrote this code in vog it's not working so there  like 10 people would like try to solve it and uh   like yeah I mean if because see back back in the  day this like this industry was not that uh well   known and it didn't pay much right so people  whoever was doing like uh this work like they   were actually passionate about uh vsi that's  why they were doing it absolutely yeah like I   think there's a huge huge demand and can you share  like is there like a limit to The Innovation that   can happen in vsi and semiconductor industry like  what if like you know 3D implementation is is fin   3D chip stacking chip over chip is there a limit  to this rule um I mean it's it's it's actually   not yet uh it's it's not proven it's still uh  undergoing like it's it's still in the works so   with 3D stacking of chips there's no limit to the  amount of power you can achieve through CPUs and   gpus that's what correct correct so so I mean uh  now companies are like stacking chips over chips   and creating chiplet Technologies uh and like this  saves power and of course it improves performance   because earlier what used to happen is like when  you had a planer surface so there would be chips   interacting in", "mimetype":

course it improves performance   because earlier what used to happen is like when  you had a planer surface so there would be chips   interacting in Islands so you had interconnect and  just interconnect car there was a lot of latency   so now now when you stack chips over chips they  interact through this tsv or through silicon VR   I see and and that is actually very low latency  so now you'll definitely see like performance   improvements so uh that is just one field like  this is Imagine like this is just a small field   where people are innovating now there are  hundreds of such Fields like this is just   transistor technology or chip technology then  there's people working on devices right how to   improve the transistor as well then there are  people working at architecture if you look at   isca right isca there's a there's a conference  where like computer people discuss computer   architecture Innovations s gra like you know CE  met met that was also one of the biggest right so   they discuss these things yeah so so I mean people  are innovating in all aspects and since there are   like four or five Fields right that I mentioned  in every field people are innovating so combine   like uh the results you can see like if you look  at even 2 three years right two chips AP which   are 2 three years apart the performance change is  incredible in this industry of chips the delivery   time is really high or electrical engineering for  example like battery temperature you know you need   to test all these is this like Electronics work  as well or no so that is more like electrical but   you did it both right electrical and electronics  uh yeah but like uh so so the difference between   electrical and electronics is like whenever you're  working at uh anything below 5 volts uh now it's   even lower but 5 volts anything below 5 volts is  electronics okay anything above that is electrical   okay so so all these batteries like U especially  for cars they're like very high voltage they have   a lot of WTS like they store a lot of power so  that is electrical like that delivery of power is   electrical when you're like talking about uh small  chips like which go in uh the phones though or   like laptops or servers they are like Electronics  I see what do you enjoy more you measuring in both   so so I mean um I would say Electronics because  it's almost similar to surgery I would say like   it's that precise because uh I think I'm not sure  I think the radius of like uh our human here is   like in microns and we're working in nanometers  like it's like very very minute and and and and   it's like the best part is uh it's like designing  a city cuz you don't just have like X and Y so   it's not just two Dimension it's three dimensions  because now you're also going up in terms of metal   stack so so it's like a routing problem for like  a city for example right and you have to there   are like signals and powers like for example  highways and interstates and all those things   so routing those things uh and I think there's a  lot of constraint in that and it's really fun like   dealing with those constraints coming up with like  really innovative ways to solve these problems so   it's like you're creating your own world right  absolutely yeah so in this design like what is   the difference between Hardware engineering and  electronics and electrical engine Electronics   or electrical explain but where does Hardware  engineering come into this so so uh like in   electronics are other field as well for example  you have embedded systems uh interet things you   have communication uh so that is Electronics in  a whole and I would say Hardware comes within   the uh sphere of electronics but Hardware is just",

example if you're making chips uh that would be   considered Hardware Tech I would say yeah so  so um for example if you're making chips for   a an iPhone or a smartphone or uh some laptop or  maybe some server that's that's called Hardware   engineering now so yeah I mean I mean basically  any anytime you're making chips like in Silicon   it's called Hardware engineering so what is  your role what right okay uh so my role is uh   as I mentioned it's it's essentially converting  logic uh which is in terms of gates so there   will be a lot of logic gates you have to convert  that into uh a layout which is a which is sort   of an image and then you give this image to the  fabrication unit for example tsmc or uh Samsung   or some fabrication and they will take that image  and essentially using lithography and etching and   all those Technologies they'll just etch that  uh image on a semi so a silicon I see why you   know tsmc takes two years so it's it's not just  tsmc is like um maybe tape out would take like   3 months or 4 months right but tape out tape out  means uh essentially okay fabrication of uh this   chip uh so when like for example if I give uh my  like layout to tsmc today it'll take 4 months or 3   months for them to uh like etch the entire chip or  create the the entire chip uh and that is because   like it's a very complicated process you have like  lots of processes right uh so that's that's just   three or 4 months but majority time is taken  to design what I am talking about like layouts   so layouts take like one year oh your work is  taking the most yeah one year like I would say so   is industry there are like parts to it let's can  you break it down like stage one stage two stage   three correct okay so let's understand the step  by step absolutely and which which stage you are   okay so so it's a top down approach right so you  have the architecture which is essentially CPU   or GPU for example CPU may there's this thing  like okay uh do you want to go with uh risk or   cisk right or you want to for example you want to  have a five stage pipeline or 10 stage pipeline   right uh so architecture people will decide those  right and then they will give this architecture   to the logic design team or the RTL team the RTL  team will convert this architecture convert that   architecture specification into verilog code right  or system verog code which is essentially an HDL   now that is called logic right because that can be  synthesized into a uh sort of chain of logic gates   and once you synthesized that that's when I come  in and you say that okay uh we want to convert   this chain of logic gates into a layout and layout  made there are lot of constraints like you need to   meet uh the LVS which is basically checks so  you'll have LVS emir all those checks so you   need to meet those checks meet those constraints  and uh once you meet those constraints so taking   like meeting those constraints only takes like uh  one year so yeah so because it's like uh and it it   uses like your electrical engineering knowledge  it uses uh CS knowledge as well so using these   things you essentially finally come with a layout  which you can give to fabrication units industry   interesting like the job before you is Hardware  engineering you say uh so this entire process", "mimetype": "text/plain",

so this entire process   is called Hardware engineering okay this okay  now so this entire process stage one 2 three is   Hardware engineering you are in a small part of  it which is like the electrical and electronics   design converting logic gates into the next stage  correct okay awesome okay let's talk about the industrys yeah I think the L of people  like uh uh everyone that I know in my   batch like most of them like I would  say 90% they got internships really yeah uh class full there so class size is like  u i mean people are like it's a there's a lot   of competition to get in this uh and once you get  in like even the other universities like you have   UT Austin as well there like I think 30 students  in the batch of EC so 30 or 40 so like uh like in   blsi so all of those like they they get like like  there's 100% conversion in terms of jobs because   it's so selective and there are very few people  and and why would you say it's a recession Pro   job okay so like I would just say that uh this  thing like requires a lot of uh knowledge one   and the problem has not been solved yet it's taken  like I think uh 50 years and it's going to take   more time to solve this problem so this is not a  problem that you can solve for example it's not a   product that uh like software you can just like uh  uh created in one month or two months or like I'm   just saying like basic product right so it takes a  lot of time and there's still lot of aspects as I   mentioned right lot of aspects which haven't been  solved yet there are problems which are like which   still exist and nobody has a solution for them so  that's why I would say example example for example   um like you have transistors so transistors now  uh we we started with like some microns and then   we came to nanometers uh AB like I think 2014  or 2017 we were stuck at like 40 nanometer then   we came to 5 75 3 2 uh 1.8 and now people are  like okay we've reached this thing people are   so people take this for granted people take okay  we will every year new uh smartphone comes we will   get a performance Improvement right but but uh  this comes at a cost like this this is because   people are like people in Hardware Tech are doing  uh like are creating and are innovating so uh like   this will continue and people demand people  demand the same thing they they demand that   each year our smartphone should improve so that's  why this is like this demand will always exist I see people yeah exactly and there's another aspect  actually very interesting aspect regarding the AI   boom I would say so as we know like we are in an  AI boom right so um like people talk about like   okay we're going to come up with new llms new  software which is good like there's a uh need   for that as well but all those things they need  compute right Nvidia is uh winning because of this   like they have the they are like uh they have the  solution right so uh even Nvidia needs people who   can actually deliver a chip so they also if you  read like they had an issue recently their chip   didn't uh black well yeah blackw is delayed by 3  months absolutely so so why because uh they had   some issue with the out so it's in Hardware  where they had they have a bottleneck right   tsmc right no not tsmc but it's within their  own cognation in", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx":

had   some issue with the out so it's in Hardware  where they had they have a bottleneck right   tsmc right no not tsmc but it's within their  own cognation in Hardware so they have their   own Hardware team right yeah Hardware design  May problem right yeah there was a problem in   the hardware design and then once they got a test  chip uh I think it didn't work out well so they're   like okay we need to fix this and that's why uh  now they're going to like uh do it again like go   for tape out again so so yeah I mean uh even  there like the bottleneck is not software the   bottleneck is not architecture it's actual chip  implementation or getting the right layout out   so and you you're the one who figures out getting  a successful tape out tape out Bott fabrication you have TMC Samsung uh and I would say Intel  right so clearly there's a bigger bottleneck   uh and as compared to like design team because  design so many companies doing design to bottle   because it takes like I think it costs billions  of dollars to faor chip or create a fabrication unit that is just one that's the 90%  provider for lithium right and like   you know it's insane TMC comp yeah so that's  also so true yeah so so yeah I mean um like   uh this thing also like design companies are  very few like there a lot of design companies   there very few fabrication companies  just say tsmc so for example let's say   um if tsmc doesn't exist right tomorrow then  all these companies like Nvidia AMD Apple sub   they'll face a short shortage of chips because  everyone uses tsmc even Qualcomm switched from   uh Samsung to tsmc oh yeah because of the  because of the quality insane yeah okay now so how can people take advantage of it step  byep step by step for a CS student H okay so   CS student I mean I would say that uh first thing  that to do is like if you think that you want to   do RTL design or physical design you would need to  Lear learn like uh Digital Electronics to uh like   let's say if you want to do RTL or because  architecture easy it's like uh you just uh   like you know operating systems you know  algorithms so you just like learn more   about uh some Hardware software code design and  that'll be good enough but for uh this thing and   even compilers for example compilers is also a  nice field uh for Hardware soft code design so   uh let's say if you want to go for RTL or physical  design which is one of the more demanding uh areas   there you need like uh uh you need sort of you  need to know like basic of basics of electronics   you need to know uh like cosos mosfets transistors  all the logic like Electronics like you need dig   Digital Electronics analog Electronics uh analog  not that much but digital electronics at least   from simos till log still Boolean algebra so that  and like you already have CS students already have   that uh algorithms they have uh I would say data  science as well and uh like yeah that's those are   two basic like uh things that you need and after  these skills yeah what kind of interviews are like   asked like no so so is like they start with like  Basics so if let's say you're a fresher right you   have absolutely no knowledge of vsi or you have no  experience with vlsi then like they would expect   basics of uh electronics for example cosos they  will start with seos uh they want you to know   uh how uh like digital logic Works once you know  that so that's why I was saying that if you can   understand that and it's pretty interesting it's  like a you'll connect the dolls and you'll be like

that then uh I think uh they'll actually move to   algorithms they they'll ask you puzzles so example  uh for example I was like I remember when uh after   my undergrad I gave the vsi interview so I was  asked this question that uh there's a fly in a 3D   cube right and you want to uh what what distance  what is the shortest distance for the fly uh from   the I think it was one corner uh top let's say  top right corner to uh another face uh center of   the face of uh the thing so it's like okay so it  was like uh from one corner to uh the center of   the edge now the center of the edge so it's like  uh then you have to you have to know like what's   the body diagonal and and uh stuff like that so  and because you need this uh these skills to do   routing and all right so yeah yeah if you had  to restart your journey how would you do things differently I would say like if I if I knew what  I know now uh I would start like I would try for   like some high level roles for example uh so this  is like considered back end of the hardware Tech   uh front is architecture and RTL so if you start  with RTL and architecture it's very easy to move   into the back end because now you know more about  the logic for example when you're in just in back   end right i' I've always been in back end so I  was just given designs and I was told key just   uh make a layout for this I was I didn't ask like  I wasn't supposed to ask that you know why is this   happening so there was no like opportunity for  cross question at least in kayen so uh that's why   like um I wanted like if I if I could I would  have have gone into uh like a higher uh level   like front end so that I can also learn about uh  designing and then eventually move into back end   yeah so that is one thing that I would change  I see is there any exit strategy you would say   in this industry uh exit strategy as what is the  strategy you use for example I was reading Andre   who is the AI lead of Tesla right he said he left  his job at Tesla because it became very managerial think you would quit this indry um like a make  a break s of situation um it would be a very big   thing for me if like if I if I'm leaving it like I  would say probably uh if I'm not feeling that I'm   able to create the impact like if my work is not  impactful enough I would leave the industry like   like a it's like uh if I if I going to work for a  company right I would would want that I'm actually   uh saving like in in terms of power performance  or area something I'm reducing right I'm helping   them save money because if you save area it's  like so in uh semiconduct industry area is in   terms of US dollars because the more area you  save in terms of your chip the more like you'll   save in uh dollars so like I want to contribute  to that excellent and last would be what will be   the salary expectation student ENT industry what  can they expect out of the semiconductor industry   India packages and us um I would say India is  pretty good like 50 LP easy uh okay so like   fresher car I would say like you can expect 20  20 to 25 and uh like right now I would say it's   even more bloated especially like because of a  company like Nvidia Nvidia is like uh changing the   entire", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 43724, "end_char_idx": 47856, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template":

power performance  or area something I'm reducing right I'm helping   them save money because if you save area it's  like so in uh semiconduct industry area is in   terms of US dollars because the more area you  save in terms of your chip the more like you'll   save in uh dollars so like I want to contribute  to that excellent and last would be what will be   the salary expectation student ENT industry what  can they expect out of the semiconductor industry   India packages and us um I would say India is  pretty good like 50 LP easy uh okay so like   fresher car I would say like you can expect 20  20 to 25 and uh like right now I would say it's   even more bloated especially like because of a  company like Nvidia Nvidia is like uh changing the   entire industry because they are paying their uh  employees so much that other companies also have   have to catch up right so I would say 2025 and  eventually like the thing is that uh as you   like uh go higher in that thing like you have more  experience right uh your salary like exponentially   increases because there are very few people uh  in the middle like with 10 years experience or 7   years experience so that like uh sort of is a very  big thing I would say like electric engineering   say Electronics say in semiconductor industry  like is it like close to software or more than   software you'll say like 150k 200k like um I I  don't know what the salaries and software are   like could you give me an example of like 120k to  150k I'll say software it's similar to that then   similar to I I I would say some in some cases it's  more than that and especially now like now to very   few companies are hiring in software right like  I know some people in CS at Jo Tech and they're   also like struggling with the full-time jobs and  they have to like settle for like something which   is non ideal I would say so but you can enter  and break in because absolutely yeah excellent   awesome yeah thank you so much it was wonderful  talking to you I learned a lot I hope this video   adds value and students gain some wisdom and can  enter this industry and break in thank you so much", "mimetype": "text/plain",
