and then suddenly AI boom started everyone was like okay now we have to work on AI and the easiest language to work in AI is uh startups preferring to work with react python because the problem is when you learn it you're not implementing it and if you're not implementing it's of no use don't you get bored by making the content I was like actually I get bored so I wanted to do something different in Python so what I did is I used lot of VFX can you share what point of time you thought of quitting your job because technical skills will take you somewhere networking skills will take you everywhere quitting your software job to become a content creator might be easier today but quitting your job and putting everything into your passion of teaching for 10 plus years is extremely difficult and today we will learn the success and the journey of telesco from which millions of us have learned programming spring boot Java and how he runs his startup in Bangalore a quick shout out to fly with Singh where you can first of all find all templates to study abroad plus expect a call back from a consultant so you can short list the universities you must go to and apply immediately go check out fly with sing right now so hello everyone today I am in the office of telescope the Channel that I learned from Spring boot cotland 2016 Trend that Google was making cotland its official language so first Channel that I learned Android development in goland was tusco so hi tsco thank you so much for having me we will learn how this channel became a startup in Bangalore and lot to learn from him so hi n thank you so much for having me can you please introduce yourself thank you so much uh so I'm nin Ry uh also called as telescope by some people I started my journey in 2001 that's my first video on YouTube uh and now we are running a channel which has almost 2.3 million subscribers now it's fun to get to see the number but challenges comes every day so recording videos uh having fun building different systems that's what I do now primary focus is on Java but also explored blockchain and now exploring going to explore AI uh and thanks for the motivation before this video I mean soon I'll be focusing on AI as well I stay in Bangalore so mostly we be having some questions on Bangalore as well awesome so first of all let's start with the Technologies which are getting outdated for example us that you know there was a hype of Open Source Big Data tools like spark like Hadoop they are outdated now because cloud is the future so things are changing really fast and uh I mean maybe Hado might be relevant for some companies but cloud is the biggest future like companies came like data brick Snowflake and right people are moving their data to these companies and Hardware is reaching data centers as compared to normal person doesn't need to create create a room full of of gpus room full of hard drives ssds deoy and it's much more convenient so can you can you share in in terms of your T stack out is it spring boot next which is going to get outdated what are the things getting outdated now in fact uh see there are things which actually get outdated and then there are things where people say it will get outed soon uh in fact in 2006 or 7 when I started learning Java and people were saying Java is getting outdated from 2007 2007 it's been 20 17 years now 18 years Java is still there and springboard is still in the market uh but yeah but there are certain Technologies which are changing very fast in terms of cloud you mentioned uh I remember 2014 uh I saw an ad in a newspaper a company was hiring a Hado developer and they were paying they ready to pay 4 KS package wow I was like I want to learn Hadoop now so why time and I was like okay first I will complete Java series I will learn had I will make Hado series because it's trending so much but you have to also understand as a company perspective in fact discuss you mentioned about companies focus on those things which are making profit go with J they can easily maintain it and uh the talent the resource people they can be example let's say if you are working on some project and then suddenly you you feel that I want to leave this job go go somewhere else they can't depend on techologies which you use they want to make it standard to manage they Outsourcing it in fact that's why we have thiss cultureel and it was magic at one point in fact I remember 20178 when I was exploring uh Amazon uh code star so Amazon also has their own pipeline uh the way we have GitHub they have code commit which is just got uh uh they have discontinued code commit three days back uh they also have the they have the entire Pipeline and for for me it was a magic I'm writing a code in Java I'm just saying saying sa save and commit in this machine automatically I can see the build in the server for a company it becomes very easy to manage people it becomes very easy to manage the softwares now coming back coming back to uh the Java Java and stuff uh 2010 was a boom period where Java was very famous again people were talking about it will get outdated but also when I saw the market Java was everywhere and then suddenly AI boom started everyone's like okay now we have to work on AI and the easiest language to work in AI is uh python so people like okay so we have to Learn Python then learn AI on the other hand uh when you got web development easiest way to build application now is Javascript you know those those were golden days where we used to learn different technology for different stack or different layers for front end learn HTML C JavaScript for the middle we you can learn c.net or Java or PHP for the backend database technology also have to master and then JavaScript people like no you know we should we know one language we want to do everything in that language I want to do frontend we got react I wanted to to back end we got nodejs expressjs we got we wanted to go uh database also in JavaScript so we got Json formats now mongodb so everything is Javascript now when you say things are outdated lot of people also say that angular is outdated not exactly uh the thing is they have different segments in the market we got startups preferring to work with react python because it's easier to find people who can work on that and startups they have the ideas right they have they want to implement that in a in a week so they will prefer a language where people know about the language and also it is easy to build on the other hand if you talk about the Enterprise Market they go with some stable stuff they don't have this idea okay today we got the idea tomorrow we'll Implement they go with a chain of process someone will have the initiate someone will take the initiation then someone will uh plan it some some other team will execute it and then they look for Technologies which are stable which will go for a long time and that's why they prefer stable languages like okay don't bash me on this but they prefer NET Framework they prefer Java in that stack it's not like they're not using node but then preferable is still Java and uh uh net Java you can also say cotlin because it is easier to work with cotlin than Java so yeah that's how the things are nothing is getting audited is just that different company have different approach to work with totally agree same with Cloud so for for example biggest preference for companies is AWS because let's say they have a they're already using AWS and most people know AWS because AWS doing the the most amount of conferences AWS is working so good on marketing they have the most number of services so it is easier to hire an AWS Cloud developer as compared to Azure as compared to gcp so that's why the highest number of profit is also number Al also made by AWS then Azure then Cloud so it's becoming you know it's becoming a bubble and it's expanding and Google and Azure are using other ways to compete so like whatever disadvantage advantage that is the strategy they use it's same like uh same like Advantage '90s if you know IBM was the biggest software company when it started 90s May and then uh they used to use database with nodes so for example uh let's say let say you have an account number let's say this is a bank this is account number it's a node and it will have a branch for name her Na and this is how databases used to work and SQL got invented and Oracle became the first company to implement IBM was slow so disadvantage orle Advantage now it's the bigger company bigger company in software now so I think that's how the cycle plays now in with IBM I remember IBM always starts something but they're not fast enough to move as I mentioned uh in fact Watson the AI platform for IBM they were like they're talking about Watson every everywhere but then suddenly other companies are coming up and they are taking away the market yeah so whatever some companies disadvantage you can start a company there and leaded right yeah now my big question is I think in our education system in Java the biggest challenge is Java is getting updated every year but coursework is not I go to colleges in Us in India both have have problem they still learning Java 6 7 8 we have Java 22 now true like Java I was using the last J version 18 so do you think is that okay what is lacking in Java education now uh I mean not just Java it's with most of the Technologies now in fact when I was doing my degree we Al we were also outdated then when I came to the market then I understood okay that was outdated there is something you have to learn it all depends upon the students now in fact when I go to different colleges I saw few colleges are taking effort so few colleges are autonomous so they have their own uh curriculum so they are trying to implement it example let's say uh the university says we have to teach Java 7 this colleges go for Java 11 or Java let's say 14 Max the problem is colleges cannot upgrade every year they can't actually they don't have this capacity of catching away technology in fact as an independent trainer I can't catch up with the Technologies like everywhere we are going so I'm focusing on blockchain now ai is booming if I go on AI something else will boom even I can't catch up so College are doing their best or maybe they're not even doing anything it depends upon it comes down to students now they have to understand this college is only for environment college is for you to go for a structure education but apart from it you have to also learn things which are happening in the market and don't just learn everyone talks about tutorial hell YouTube is one uh you go to YouTube you follow a Creator maybe multiple creators and then you say okay I will learn this I will learn that the problem is when you learn it you're not implementing it and if you're not implementing it's of no use I have learned a lot of Technologies in my last 20 years how many I remember now only thing which I work on so don't just learn things implement it and don't depend up on your college they they will never able to catch the market but still as a college if you if anyone of them listening to this um I would encourage you to connect with industry experts at least have have one session in a week from industry expert they will not teach they will come there and they will just talk about the things are happening in the industry so that students will know what to work on so they will go home they will we have the chat GP now we got Google so we have to motivate student to learn don't teach them motivate them that's very important and same I think they should come to Bangalore and go to Luma meetup.com cerebral Valley all of these meetups some are remote some are in person attend those and learn from industry people what is happen and then then they get more motivated I think in person motivation is 10x more true true now you started with a YouTube channel you start with the journey to teach people can you can you share what people already don't know so how did you start from mumbai's chw what were the challenges of building this YouTube channel and how you convert it to a startup so 2012 you graduated uh yeah in fact when I was doing my msse uh 2011 uhhuh so at that point I was responsible so in fact we had the system in our College we can train our Juniors so I was doing Masters we were responsible to train the Juniors uh and then at one time I can't talk about the college because they would feel bad but there's a problem that I I wanted to teach something to the students but then I I was stopped then I felt K as a trainer if I love teaching I should be able to teach to everyone and then I went home I recorded my first video because at that time YouTube was not it was more for c videos I can say education was not the main Moto of YouTube to views I was demotivated or plus record is a big challenge now at least I have a good Studio I got a camera at that point recording video in that one room where you have a one bed T so you have to stop them I can record the video so I was finding it challenging supp4 uh my wife when she was my girlfriend we were discussing about what else we can do uh apart from so we wanted to build a product look at the Indian tech Market we were hardly having good trainers I can teach so I will start uploading videos we were thinking about different names example one of the name which came out is nain skills but then I don't want my name with the channel based on company I can't sell my name so we wanted to go for some unique names so Tesco came into picture or Fe we started uploading videos what does Tesco mean Tesco is a telu word which means get to know so I'm T I don't speak telu much but then I wanted to go for my mother tongue so is get to know then I started uploading videos again crowd but I was happy com after six months of uploading videos I got a comment because of this video I got the job I was like okay I'm not getting money from YouTube but at least I'm helping people so that was my first motivation and slowly stud I got I got messages from different countries uh one of my initial subscriber I think shabir is was his name uh he used to message me on LinkedIn or different platforms uh I watched your videos uh you know I've learned a lot from them but I I'm confused with this topic I was like okay I got the new content so I started uploading videos on those things which he was he wanted to learn he wanted to pay me but then I thought not a good time to pay now let's see later but that's how we started I started uploading videos 2016 came and then uh you mentioned about cotlin uh Google announced that they are making apart from java they can also use cotlin is the official language for Android it was 9:00 a.m. I got to know and I thought now people will come to learn cotlin so 11:00 a.m. we recorded the video by round two we uploaded our first video wow in a week I uploaded the entire series I was like channel was here it went there 2018 again AI hype hype was there uh people wanted to Learn Python in fact I went live on YouTube and I was talking about something and people like teach python teach python I was like I'm not into python I love Java they're like no I we want to Learn Python I thought let me try how difficult it can be to learn a new language so I learned python in one week I started uploading video but then you mentioned right before the uh before this video that do don't you get bored by making the content I was like actually I get bored so I wanted to do something different in Python so what I did is I used lot of VFX not exactly the high level VFX but then using green screen at that point it was new 2018 was lot of people were not using green screen for the videos I used green screen animations on the screen and one video was taking one day to edit and I recorded around 100 videos so the entire 6 months I was making python videos and that was fun it took time but it was fun and channel was here after Cartland two years python took it somewhere else and then I came to know that people want to learn it's just that when they want to learn something they want to I me it's it's our job to make it interesting right how do you keep them engaged because nowadays because of Instagram and all those tools we don't have patience we want to see things in 5 seconds if you don't like it swipe how do we make it interesting for a tutorial where you're talking about let's say doing a login form using python how do you make it motivating so that's the thing I was trying to do uh then uh at one point I wanted to explore different Technologies I had a team because initially yesterday I was doing my uh content creation recording editing I was doing by myself at one point I thought I need people so I started hiring people for editing then for Content creation for managing the company and uh supporting the Audi because we have we done different courses on on on our platform so we wanted to provide support to them so in that case the company grew up not the initial plan I don't I'm not a people person where I can manage people I can I can actually but I realized when I started managing people I can't work on my own things because making a video creating content is a creativity work and if you are into creative work you you want people to leave you alone and if you get a call we have to talk we have to discuss about this things you get distracted so now I try to avoid it but again if you run a company you don't you don't have a choice so yeah balancing life between employees YouTube and family so lot of uh people in tech industry talk about quitting their job for content creation for the startup in Bangalore so can you share what point of time you thought of quitting your job was it when YouTube Revenue went same level or above it above your full-time job okay good question because again the same year 2016 uh before CTL so what happened is I was uh doing uh trainings I was doing a lot of trainings in different companies I left my software job because I I used to love teaching and I got to know that training gives me more money than in software development and I got into training I was making good amount of money in 2016 and then when I saw the YouTube stats it was looking good so I was rning 10% of what I I was making as a a corporate trainer uh and then I thought okay this is good but then when I looked at my YouTube videos I was uploading videos once in a week and then I used to you I used to look at the comments they saying waiting for the next video I want to learn this topic I was not able to manage making videos and doing corporate trainings then I the day I I I thought okay what if I can make one video or two videos per day can I survive with the revenue from YouTube I thought I can't but I do have a saving so I switched I stopped doing any all the trainings in fact I was doing uh seven to eight trainings per year came down to one training per year and then currently I'm also doing training one one training per year just to be in the market just to go there just to meet people uh I stopped doing training I was only focusing on you for two years I was surviving with one/ tenth of the revenue of what used to make so my expense was almost above than what I was getting almost 10 times yeah so you took a risk right but what what is Corporate Training can you explain uh so the thing which I do on YouTube I used to do in corporate so example when companies hire different candidates and they have a project on Java they have a project on which is springboard or python so I go there to teach them different Technologies so it's more of a consulting job where you have to also talk about the curriculum what so some companies they have the reded curriculum this is what you have to teach some companies they say we have this project we have this candidates you have to take them from here to there you decide what you want to teach but just make them ready so it was fun yeah I've seen even in big companies Amazon Microsoft meta uh all the we big companies uh even even like you know Google has their learning platform where they teach their own employees because they use their own tools so they do online sessions online recordings so it's something similar right kind of similar yeah similar okay now what are the real challenges of running a startup in Bangalore I can tell you the real challenges of San Francisco and San Jose is they call it man Jose they they they struggle with finding girls in the city this just people talk about it's just Tech and less job market for people who don't want jobs in Tech so is B Bangalore you think similar is it like Mangalore or Bangalore you can say Mangalore because in fact in Tech in general when you talk about tech uh the male ratio is much higher than female ratio uh there are several reasons to it but then we have to change it we have to motivate uh women in Tech and most of the companies are doing that that's a good initiative they are taking uh apart from that one of the challenges is the cost in Bangalore it's much higher in fact I was born by in Mumbai to and people say that Mumbai is very costly compar if you talk about Indian cities they used to think Mumbai is the costliest one then we shifted to Bangalore and now the things are changing I am finding Bangalore is much costlier than Mumbai uh that's one that's one issue uh another issue is lot of tech people are there in Bangalore that's a good thing for me because when I go out when I used to go in go out in Mumbai let's say there's a chance that at least one person will recognize me in Bangalore it's more so I know when if I go to a market at least one person will be there who will say I've seen you somewhere is it the same guy I'm not sure maybe I look different in real life compared to YouTube uh so those are the good things but also challenge because we have lot of tech people and since we have lot of tech people that there's lot of money in Bangalore since there a lot of money in Bangalore the cost is going up but running a startup is always difficult doesn't matter the city is managing people is one of the biggest thing of especially finding good talent and okay there are two things one Talent is important but also their mindset some people are talented but they don't don't want to work much and there are people who are not that talented but they give their heart out to work on your project so I prefer the person I'm second category it's okay when if you're not that good with Talent or the technology you should be excited to work it's like the same principle like high Fast Fire fast like you know cicon Valley has the same it's very very fast goinging okay and in terms of the cost of course Mumbai I when I travel in Mumbai and travel in Bangalore I feel the difference challenge which tech industry people talk about is that Apartments like maybe it's very expensive 20 30,000 rupees they will take 6 months of security deposit of your rent and or in the same city people with 3 lakh rupees package a year and one CR rupees with three four years of experience are able to cope up and what are the challenges when there is that much pay differences in the same city in fact we had the same discussion before moving to Bangalore the good thing is we are living outside Bangalore so the cost is not that high compared to city and I've seen lot of employees they share the rooms so example they share one or two BK Max so difficult to survive withs in Bangalore but look manage there now last what is the future of telescope when is since it is a startup what are what students can expect in the next few years so there are two things which we are doing now one uh I have spent lot of time teaching lot of time spending on YouTube I've observed one thing when you talk about trainers I have seen all amazing trainers in the world because I'm I'm a corporate trainer I meet them and when they go into classroom in 5 10 minutes the students are like wow but the same person when they come in front of camera they struggle because they don't know how to teach to a camera so one of my aim in next few years is teaching how to teach or sharing my experience how I came came from corporate world to the camera world uh next we are planning to launch some more products enough of teaching more of uh products to help students in terms of uh now we have all this platform right lead code and all the stuff apart from it I want to focus on some product where they can learn building projects not just building small applications big projects working in a team because when you join a company you have to work in a team and what they don't learn Now is working in a team uh even if you do a course you're learning it alone you're not you're not going to work alone in a company so we want to build that system where at the start itself they can they will learn how to work in a team how to work work on a big project and what are the issues they can find in the industry to solve it and you get a bootstrap all the way everything is Bo strap so we there's a point when we thinking about uh getting funding we we might get funding but the problem is once you get funding investors have lot of say to what you should do and I'm the not kind of person who can go with the invest investor way I have my own plans and we are making enough money so that we can implement it awesome and what would be the final advice for students because AB what people have told me that AB currently in Bangalore 80% jobs are software which are booving much more poaching happening LinkedIn software it is the boom of software era in Bangalore and now slowly it's 20% AI it's going to move more into AI so what advice you would give to students so that they can catch up okay one thing very important uh as I mentioned before don't just learn things implement it it's very important right so it doesn't matter how much you learn it's first thing you have to implement stuff go with the trending one uh example AI is there now focus on AI maybe you don't want to master not everyone is meant for AI uh you can learn AI in two ways one actually learning Ai and second is how to use AI uh what is booming more is how do we use AI to implement our own stuff nowadays uh but very important Implement and learn new things also go to different events we were discussing about different events as you mentioned about different platforms the only thing which I was using is meetup.com but uh hu mentioned some of the AI I mean event uh websites go there attend the events network with people very important because technical skills will take you somewhere networking skills will take you everywhere so make sure that you improve your communication and networking skills wonderful and it's better to be a jack of all trades rather than master of one because that's better than than master of none yeah thank you so much naen it was very nice meeting you learned a lot and please check out his channel as well we' have done another video and and we'll be in touch thank you so much thank you so much for begin sure

Wow! What an amazing view! So ready guys for Grand Canyon in Arizona Very excited! Ok ready? Ok Yeah, I'm ready too Yeah morning tiredness, I can see By the way, Had a bit bad experience in this Airbnb For example: Here tap is not working in Kitchen and let's close it, who knows when it'll turn on Tap is not working and wifi was very sketchy I had a presentation yesterday It was very stressful So they'll give a bit refund But yeah overall, it was a decent stay I would say Okay bye Let's go So, got our SUV ready for our dream trip Have you seen the movie?

Harnoor's bad jokes are so bad So now guys we're at Sedona Sedona is the name of city This is red rock state park of Arizona This is on the way to Grand Canyon Now can't believe if this is amazing then Like if this is amazing then Grand canyon will be epic. We have Arihander coming from San Francisco And we have Frank also from San Francisco So, is the life actually worth it because Its every computer science dream to be in Silicon valley How's the scenario in 2024? I think San Francisco is a good place to live I mean, a lot of people don't stay long It's kinda like You go there and there's new grad experience And it's a city that has a lot of extremes Like it's very expensive There's lot of homeless There's also lot of big attractive stuff to do Correct Beautiful areas like you know No, it sucks! Everything is closed at 2AM Everything's closed at 2AM Really! Yeah like That's so bad It's so terrible like There's this rule that everything has to be closed at 2am Oh god But why can't we have both! I'd say the restaurants and cafes Atleast for my kind of lifestyle But do you like the network, You both? Yeah, the tech network is strong Ok, no worries Now this is an amazing view Just filled the gas now Excited for Grand Canyon and Vegas So, these are deers? or reindeers or something? So guys, we have made it to Grand Canyon And the great Grand Canyon, Here we will see the sunset point Here is the most beautiful sunset point. So, excited for it It's at 10 min walk from here Till now we've just paid $35 for the parking So this is the point The epic sunset view! Oh wow! What an amazing view! It is known as the wonder of the world It is pretty good yes right I mean, it is epic and worth it So epic So compared to Canada which park comes closer to this Banff is very beautiful Its a different thing and different vibe You can't compare It is natural beauty That peak is very beautiful! Oh wow! We'll see the sunset right there when the sun will set We'll go there to see now Will have to walk there brother Sunset is hiding there Sometimes it is here We have to walk all the way to the peak to see sunset on that side Will have to fully go on that end We have to go all the way to that end How many national parks I've been to I've been to 3 in Washington Olympic In east, I've been to smokeys And Favourite is this? Obviously! I mean it has very good first time views. But one thing that I want to see here, which we will see tomorrow that Is there anything to do or it is just a view? That we'll get to know tomorrow Like how are the hikes and trails And how is the overall experience True, let's go there to see the sunset And by the way bro, You know there are thousands of caves here and It's whole size is even bigger than the Rhode island The state of Rhode Island Can you believe it! Size of whom? of this Great Canyon Its not that big bro! I'm serious, I read about it It's like 2000 sq miles Can you believe it? And not just this The temperature here, like somewhere is snow and somewhere there isn't because temperature ranges to upto 25 degrees here, up and down. One place to another It's not that big bro 2000 sq miles Can you believe it! No Its really epic! I didn't knew this much Yes It's like truly maginificant feeling But Rhode island is very beautiful This can be compared with Jordan's petra It's not less than that Amazing You made of Petra right? Yes I made There are so many amazing view points I mean its so big! See it 2000 sq miles and it's so big And can you believe? Even after all that This is not World's deepest cave More deepest than this exists but this is the biggest one. Where they exists?? Somewhere I think Will have to check that Bro, World's deepest cave exists in Georgia Athlanta? In Georgia country There it is even more deeper than 2000 sq miles This is less than 2000 Sorry, it is more in Georgia and lesser here How many national parks you've been to? This is my 2nd We went with you to Reineer When you were doing internship in Seattle in Meta That time It gets mixed up Wow Not visible because of that cloud Reflection of sun is coming there So cool. The moon looks so good and we staying in Grand canyon We're staying inside in this lodge So boys have checked in Yes!!! Room is ordinary Who am I sucking tonight So, who will sleep with each other? Don't put this in video I don't have any issue, I can sleep anywhere yeah, so size matters So bigger size with smaller size Guys, today was so much fun we had so much fun Let's come to reality from this hotel room because as engineers and common people We're surrounded by cyber security threats everywhere Whether it is companies in Vegas like MGM where they had loss of $100million because of one cyber security attack And similar is happening in Roku now All their data is leaked. So, to stay safe from these attacks. A simple hack you can use is by using a VPN Because with VPN, all of your data in your device and internet becomes encrypted. And you become anonymous No one can tell from which country you're And this simple hack can keep you secure in the world of internet That's why I use my favourite VPN called SurfShark because firstly, it allows me to use on unlimited devices. My android phones, my laptops, ipads everything Plus it allows me to have less subscriptions because because peacock, HBO, netflix eevrything asks for subscription With SurfShark, I can change country to India Get the store unblocked Plus to get youtube premium for 100rs a month almost which is India's pricing So, what are you waiting for guys So, full moon guys and you can see so many stars I see the sky full of stars I think it won't come in phone but it is so epic. I see the sky full of stars We woke at 6am to see the sunrise and again cloudy weather And its freezing yeah its freezing So I got burrito and a cup of hot milk. Hot milk? yeah I know hot milk is healthier. So, that's why Coffee has zero calories. yeah but milk will fill you up for the hike Caffeine is not like good for you Its better than cocaine When you visit cities then you realize that national parks are most b'ful here Yeah My goal is to visit all before 30. Till now, how much you've reached? 5-6 Show your passport to me also It doesn't have old stamps now, This is new one Really? The ones I have visited are not in it How many national parks are there in US? Like, there's a passport for it to keep track 50 something Oh wow So, you can put all the stickers there And I think this should be one of the top 10 atleast This is their visitors centre. There's a show as well This is how we get stamped Let's do the stamp Stamp on passport That's free so, first stamp is in And, here we go Oh yeah They change it everyday mar' 23 Oh really! yeah yeah It's like a country's stamp. From visitor centre we got to know the best hike trail. So we have decided to go to South so, that is around 4 hours And views for all are same but this is most popular one. And here are many vehicles of US govt. also And they have a different license plate So, we're taking this bus for the hiking trail It's not this one? See there's written Kaibab route So, hiking begins guys And majority people who die here You know how it happens I asked them, How many times accidents happen? Peak time is august People literally like be on this and then they're relaxing and this is fall off Oh, Be careful..Don't be on this edge And many accidents happen with the selfie stick too Like people have tripod and they get lost in vlogging In August month here, We were talking before They said "In august, 5 helicopters were actually 5 helicopters came in august month, You know that right? They had to fly them out straight to the hospital If you get bitten by the snake Then you have to pay $10k for that Antitode More like $30k But I mean, that's healthcare in the US for you They have the antitode, a lot of countries don't have that Yeah So, you'll get the antitode but it's like $30k Helicopter's cost and ambulance cost is $800 one way and lot of costs. If you get bitten by a snake, so be careful very careful Have to be very careful And what cons it has, please tell those also Audience must know this Most are rattle snakes and here is that also Let me just tie my laces Let me tie my laces. Here is rattle snakes and scorpions also. There's a lot here And just in case, Snake bites you then what we'll do Then helicopter will come and take me It is really epic hike The view is very nice. So amazing But have to be careful walking Need to be very careful I also read that the height is so big that half of the people get heart attack So they die in between and then they land. And remember guys, this is a desert At the end of the day, you have to drink lots of water Everywhere check points will come, So I have two bottles with me And hike is of 4 hours Like yeah, Oh my god! And once again, it is unbelievable to imagine that Like this walk is so long that it is so long that it is even longer than a state of US Longer than Rhode Island Bigger than Rhode Island in sq m area as well as in length. Can you believe it too? yeah, that's crazy And those who are curious that how it was formed It was formed through colorado river It was all water and then dried up and led to the formation of the Grand canyon Like going is so easier because you're on the right side. But while coming back, people were stopping for us Because when people walk on the left side, it is very scary. Coming back is gonna be scarier, we're gonna be on the edge. If you slip, you're done Yeah basically. Here, the weather difference is a lot 25 degrees change up and down. It's a lot of temperature change around the Grand Canyon It's hot now and it was cold up there. Oh gosh! Don't do that On the way back, you can have horses I guess. So this is the Ooha point Wow, we came from all the way top till here. Half of the way is done A lot is still left So, dangerous with the wind. We're here on such good trail. And such views, they're seeing first time and it is going to be their last time also I mean you can take an Indian out of India but you can't take India out of them Oh be careful! Don't fall back Don't fall back You're right The view is amazing Oh wow SO, that is end That is end and there is colorado river part. So, next checkpoint guys If you want to hike more From there river is also visible but not worth it, its just mud So, we're just stopping here Till here is 110 sq m elevation So, it'll be very difficult to go up. But if you go down its less elevation which is 900 but its not worth it. They said its not worth it to see the mud and river If you want another one hour down and two hours up. Just got to know that this is also 1100 elevation Too much Wow What a hike! We can get very nice picture here How you feel? We finally did it guys Energy is back Back to earth Line for bus to go home. Totally worth it, It was so much fun Was lot of fun, right? It was so much fun! I think we should just drive Good choice Good choice We're in line, finally its so long Line is so big! Frank brother has gone to touch them. Long line now and then directly food and then next Vegas Great trip to Grand Canyon Vegas is four hours from here. Anyone who comes here, I would say it's really worth it Hike is a bit difficult But if you can do then definitely come Even if you can't still come and try as much as you can. And don't go too down as well. because while going down you don't get to know like how much down we're And then its difficult to come up. Then it is difficult Go only that much deep, how much you can afford.

Friends, in India, a student can go to a med school right after their 12th grade. But in USA you have to do Pre Med for four years in order to go to a med school So that's why today I decided to challenge pre med students in Johns Hopkins University with our most difficult medical entrance exam called NEET. And the rules were pretty simple. 3 questions in 3 minutes. From physics, chemistry or Biology. So this is an exam from our Indian Medical entrance exam. So we are given 180 questions- around 200 questions to be done in 180 minutes. And what's your favourite subject by the way? - Probably Chemistry. - So this has Physics, Chemistry, Botany and Zoology. By the way, would you like to introduce yourself? Oh, I am Crystal and I am a chem major a pre med. I will hopefully go to Med School. Oh, so it's just pre med, right? So you do 4 years pre med and then 4 years med school, right? How do you feel about the paper so far? I am a first year med student so I haven't learned a lot of it. So it's just scary looking through this. What did you say the topics are? The topics are Chemistry, Physics, Botany and Zoology. 2 categories of Biology. So we are supposed to do this in our 12th grade because we don't have pre med. So this is our like- High school stuff. Botany? Yeah, I mean, you can just Botany, I think. That could be... Where is the Botany section? Botany is in the end. I could do this. 100%. I could do this! That's Physics row, right? Yeah, I can see that! In one minute you can? - You sure? - Oh! In one minute? Is she allowed to help me or not? No! No.. That was really quick! In one minute! Yeah, that's quick. Okay. Okay, so I got that wrong. 123. Okay.. Never mind. 147. Oh! never mind. You will still win 20 dollars! I will do it right after you are done! What's your name and what's your major? My name is Marwa and I am also a chem major and a math major as well. Awesome. And after your pre med what are your plans? Like you wanna do.. go for..? Med school hopefully. Oh nice. So you got all three? Awesome. Let's check the answer sheet. 2. That's right. 97... Number 2. That's right as well! Oh my God! Drum Roll! 3rd Question! 145.. It's 2. OHHH! - Sorry. - So close! You still won 20 dollars for participating. Don't worry. Is pre med hard or it's easy like.. how do you feel about pre med so far? We just started our classes. This is our first year.. So... So I am taking like Chem 1 and 2, Physics 1, Bio 1 So it's like all the basic linkage of classes. Nice. What are your plans after pre med? It's the same thing. Like.. probably go to med school and hopefully be a surgeon I am looking to either neuroscience or cardiology. I think most popular is internal medicine right? Yeah. I think it's mainly internal medicine because of the family and work balance. The work life balance. Nice talking to you. Thank you so much for your time! Would you like to introduce yourself first? Yeah! Okay. So I am Kaitlyn. And... and we currently go to Johns Hopkins University in Undergrad I am studying biophysics right now. Awesome! So what would you be pursuing after pre med? I don't know! That's a great question! Yeah, I am not really sure what I wanna do yet. Whether it's the actual going into medical school or... How about you? I am Isioma and I am also at Hopkins and I am studying medicine science and humanities I wanna be a PA surgeon but I don't.. - Nice! - yeah. And.. What about you? Hi! I am Soliana. I am also a student at Johns Hopkins I am studying molecular and cellular Biology And hopefully to be a pediatric oncologist! Pedria- sorry how do you? - Pediatric Oncologist. Kids.. Like a doctor who treats kids who have cancer. Pediatrician. Pediatrician? Okay. Perfect. So who wants to do first? Not me bro!! Okay. So basically this is NEET exam. This is our medical exam for high school students. So we take this exam to get into college as a medical student. I took humanities in High school. So let's see. Let's see. You take the exam to get.. - Where!! Where do you take this exam? In India. That's sick! It's one of the most challenging exams in India because you have to do 200 questions in 3 hours! That's a lot. That's so much. So do you get straight into medical school then? Yes! That's... This is gonna be so bad... If only!!! So basically it consists of Physics, Chemistry, Botany and Zoology. So what are your favourite subjects among these? What's my favourite? I like probably Physics and... Bro! I need to know how to do this!! 32. Is that 4? - That's right! 24. Is that one? Yes!! 123, I circled it. So I don't know where.. Oh no it's wrong!! NOOOO!! Oh, it sucks! By one question! Sorry... Oh my Gosh!! It's okay! You got two right! Who's next? Will you go? Or you want me to go? I'll go! Let's see. Let's see. Do you think med school is hard? (In the meantime) I feel like.. definitely. Just actually we were talking about that earlier. Pre med within itself is just hard enough for us. So I'll see. Well I am excited. I am excited to see what the future holds. 145... It's 2. Right. Okay. 1 right. I'm happy. We did it! That's all. 79.. 4.. Sorry. It's fine! It's fine.! 81? 3! Yes!! 2 correct! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yeah. You got 2 right! I can't hold the periodic table right? We can't see? No, we are not given in our NEET exam. You all are given periodic table but we are not. Let me solve this.. In order of least to greatest, Increasing. Yeah, okay. 32. So it's 2. Yes! Oh wow! You got this! Next number is 45 maybe? 45? - Oh yeah, 45 is 2! (EVERYONE CHEERS) You have done 2. 2 more, right? Okay. 166... 166... - So close. 1. You got it right!!! Congratulations. And last one. You did an extra fourth. Oh yeah. Let's just see. 28. 4. 28, 2... Sorry. Oh... that's fine. So what do you all think about the exam? Is it doable in three hours? In three hours how many questions? 180. Ohhh! No! 200 questions. That's difficult. And the only reason I feel like I was able to do do things was after almost a year of college. So... fresh outta high school?? I don't know.. That's diff- So kudos! Kudos to people that take that and pass that. So what's your name and what's your major? I am Valentina and I am a major in Neurosciences. Oh nice. So your plan is to do med after pre med, right? Yeah. So what's your plan after pre med, like Internal medicine or you have decided? I don't know... Not sure... Awesome! And where are you from? - Los Angeles. - Awesome. So you can go for it. You are pretty fast first of all. 62 is 3... Sorry. 92... 4. Yes! 45.. This is 2! Congratulations! Wait. Can I try? What is this for? It's a medical challenge. So this is our exam. So like.. if you have three options, you have three questions. you have to solve those three questions in 3 minutes. If you solve all of them you get 100 dollars. Are they multiple choice? Yes!! If I get 2 out of 3, do I get 70 dollars? No... That's crazy! That's crazy! She got 2 out of 3.. You get to pick your questions. - Oh really? - yeah. It's not that hard. Is this going out on YouTube? Alright. Ay, Instagram @tjbaii - Oh my God! So what's your favourite subject? Probably Mathematics. Maths is not an option. Math's not an option? That's crazy!! That's crazy! Cause he's a math major. Is there no math? You are not pre med? I am not pre med. Ohh! It's for pre med only! No-no-no! I am pre med. I am pre med. I am pre med!! Sorry.. What is the issue here? I am a computer science major. Oh! And what's your name? My name is Tjbaii. Add Instagram at Tjbaii! Okay! And.. Okay. It's awesome. Go ahead! And where are you from? I am from Michigan. Oh nice. That's quite close. So what do you feel about the exam? Amazing!! BOOM. Hundred percent! I am done! Okay. Let's check the answer sheet. Okay, wait-wait-wait! This one is right for sure, right? - Okay, you solved two? - I solved three. So 25 - 4. That's right. - BOOM!! - Yes!! BOOM! What else? - So I told you guys too. - 54. 54 - 1. I was so close! You were close! Yeah, all good. Estrogen. 57 is 2. That's right!

in the last few months something strange is happening in tech industry for international students I would say less than 15% nobody has to program and that the programming language it's human seniors senior software Engineers are in a demand if you follow tldr Bloomberg Wall Street Journal any Tech news you will only see news about AI you know maybe software engineering doesn't exist anymore what is happening what is wrong with tech industry right now in the US and all over the world let's talk about in this video so hi everyone I hard currently working as a software engineer at Microsoft and I have been so close to Silicon Val Engineers AI Engineers so four important things in this video update on the layoffs broken senior only Tech market update from the FDA and interest rate departments about the new hiring process and last what tech industry wants in 2024 number one layoffs so this is a story about h&v a couple in Bay Area who they were having a really good life both for making almost 200k plus salary having a great time and suddenly one of the employee of a big tech company not a small startup they get an email I was so scared that I was going to have like a panic attack an urgent email invite from a hiring manager yeah come immediately we need to talk about it the person is very nervous and that person is called to the hiring manager's cabin without giving time to pick up the computer no no time at all nothing but the person goes to hiring manager's desk he's given a notice K you are laid off and you should leave right now and exit the building no time given to pick up stuff from the desk he had the only photo of his mother on the desk and and suddenly kicked out of the desk also Google when they laid off employees the next day they open their laptop and they see that oh they don't have access to their computer no time given to take out the personal data from their computer and layoffs are so toxic sometimes that this is done so that when a person is going back to their desk they don't like you know use abusive language and they don't disturb the productivity of rest of the employees so that's why it is done as silently as possible which makes it really really toxic and when you leave that employer you feel like you know you have done a crime there's a bunch of research that finds that layoffs not surprisingly can lead to all kinds of bad things 20% decline in lifetime earnings increased risk of divorce cardiovascular disease depression even suicide you're no less than a criminal in tech industry when you're laid off but the harsh truth is this is part of American culture more than 40% of employees will get laid off at some point of time and this has been happening from the last 60 70 years as per the data now number two why layoffs are hard right now even in this third quarter so third quarter in the US has started since 1st July there were layoffs from Microsoft there were layoffs from many big tech companies the moment this quarter began so why layoffs are hot so much right now in 2024 is it AI is it something else so number one is non AI reason which was the movement done by Elon Musk so Elon Musk led the team of Twitter there were eight 1,000 employees in Twitter and laid off 70% of the workforce now there are only 2,000 people now if you look at Twitter app many people say it is better than before the application is light lightweight it is much faster than before and it works pretty seamlessly and it did not need seems like yeah 8,000 employees were not needed with 2,000 employees it is enough so as per Josh as well I watched his video he very well said that there is definitely area in tech industry when they hire more people they make their investors happy yeah we are hiring more people we are growing and we will make more Revenue we'll bring more Revenue as well so hiring more people is a sign that your company is doing well that's why companies Keep On hiring and the engineers sometimes for example at Snapchat they had a uiux engineering team of 400 people and Snapchat maybe doesn't need 400 people working on buttons UI they can just like Twitter they can maybe work productively with maybe 5 10 20 ux designers so there is definitely some hyper skills hyper category of Engineers which are not needed they are basic doing basic stuff they're just over hired even now that are being released slowly just to keep investors happy and just to show Wall Street that next quarter will be highly generating Revenue quarter so it's all about keeping the investors happy now next category of AI layoffs so it is true that AI has caused some sort of layoffs for example Shopify CEO there was a leak from Shopify CEO's message that the the biggest reason of layoffs has relationship with AI and I discussed with you know the AI expert from Silicon Valley from the professor Dr Ahmed banfa and he also agreed as well that AI will cause more layoffs but at the same time currently even now the more layoffs are customer engineering layoff for engineer layoffs but not experienced Engineers who are getting laid off who know gcp as well Azure as well aw as well no those are extremely rare happening in tech industry so let me give you an example uh currently when I was working at NCR so in NCR we use two Cloud platforms when I I was working there they use gcp as well they use you know AWS as well so if an engineer already knows those two cloud cloud platforms and they are already you know above a common engineer who knows these two Cloud platforms they're never going to get laid off but if there's an engineer who just knows AWS and is not able to you know go above and beyond responsibilities though W sh can be laid off so that's why I think there is definitely huge demand in Cloud I want to tell you AWS Amazon just you will be shocked this is the biggest AI news Amazon is going to use nuclear energy for their AI data centers directly from the nuclear plant this is this has never happened before Mark Z think before we hit that you're going to run into energy constraints said this in this in his podcast that biggest bottleneck biggest barrier to entry for AI is not the data it's not not the gpus it's not the hardware it is energy it is so true it is coming out to be true now that Amazon needs so much more energy for AI power data centers that they are going to pull out energy from nuclear power directly they're going to use nuclear energy and that shows how much demand after AI is in cloudbased learning you know these distributed system even the podcast I did with you know AI engineer in February we talked about that more demand is for software Engineers with distributed system knowledge and it is still so so true so that's why I am so glad to partner with code Cloud which allows you to you know use Amazon AWS gcp Plus Azure learn all those three together with one subscription and they don't like you know just give you tutorials they tell you go sign in to gcp experiment experiment with AKs clusters all the cloud services you need to know to be valuable for these AI companies to be an AI engineer so I love code cloud and you can go check out and get the specialty with my link in description below so how many people you think are actually getting job percentage wise uh percentage wise like it's below 10% now number three continuing with job market still International students are struggling to get a job I went to Stony Brook University I went to NYU more than 60% of international students haven't gotten a job yet it is so shocking more than 60% they will either do there another Masters either go back to India or maybe just do volunteering as a research assistant at the University or maybe do a PhD so they're trying all the options as possible so that they don't have to go back home and it is one of the worst time for international students someone can imagine now let me tell you the reason for that so recently Federal Trade Administration they released the news that let's say an engineer works for AWS Amazon you know they work for their Cloud platform now they want to go to their competitor like Amazon's competitor is Walmart or aw's competitor is Google Cloud platform now they want to go they can go easily that is not a problem anymore and these laws were you know uh earlier restricting employees to go to competitors now they can easily go unless you make above 150k or you are a senior engineer so if they are senior they cannot go if they are not senior they can go if they make less than 150k they can go if they make more than 150k they have those anti-competitive rules non-compete agreement there that prevents them to go to competitor so because of that this Market is more senior so let's say if a senior engineer comes to AWS they will be less like likely to go to gcp less likely go to Walmart less likely to go to competitors so this Market has become a senior only broken market now how to you know come out of this broken senior market how to be an engineer who can easily be hired so I you know with my 3 years plus of experience I apply I get a you know position easily because I am in that senior category but someone who is starting new in the US job market how can they break this barrier number one is they can ask their re research assistant for example when I was working in my University as a research assistant I asked my professor yeah can I just use the title senior senior research assistant they were like sure so just you know ask wherever you're working whether it's as a student if it's a teaching assistant you can just put Senior in it and ask the ask the employer can I put Senior in my title and you can cut that non senior market from your resume and be senior ready in in this you know senior is a is a buzz word in in the valley right now Whoever has like software engineer 2 or senior this these are just numbers if you can somehow put in your resume you break the site since you recruit a lot what are the most high paid jobs you see in the valley is it AI software engineer cyber security what are the ones you see well when we look at the websites with seller raes we can see that um senior seniors senior software Engineers are in a demand because for for example last week one of my friends got an offer for 800k wow where where was it this um it was uh Facebook so again data scientists machine learning Engineers AI specialist all seniors are always in demand so don't please don't be afraid of losing that job then AI cannot substitute those jobs number two is everyone is using AI generated rums these days everyone have the buzzword because yeah there are so many AI tools like teal Ai and all that I don't you know use that because at the end of the day up directly chat GPT use you can use directly chat GPT because at the end of the day all these AI tools are using some sort of llm like chat GPT and using some sort of prompt why use the third party and pay for it if Chad GPT Gemini and Claud are free give a prompt and just give the best prompt look for the best prompt and get all the buzz words for senior market this should be the prompt tell me if I am a senior versus now what will the buzz worth I have to add to my resume to be senior engineer use chat GP to be in your favor because these prompts no one knows they just ask the chat GPT yeah improve my resume no you have to improve your resume by comparing it with senior resume you need to know about it and chat GPT and all these llms are already trained with that data so these two strategies can help you come out of that senior only broken market and and number four is this job market is different currently genzies have chosen more white collar jobs as compared to older generation of Millennials because of that there is shortage in construction job market there is increase of $28,000 per year salary of any construction engineer or construction people that is so amazing because people are so hyped up about tech industry more people are choosing this major computer science and supply has increased so much and demand is kind of similar as before so that's why it is very important to stand out and for standing out I tell you number one the biggest advice I've given these days is don't just blindly email any hiring manager go to your browser look for all the conferences all the tech events where hiring was happening now the recruiters which were already hiring in those events they're still hiring now probably and email those recruiters who want to hire people as compared to just blindly emailing all the recruiters on LinkedIn no you need to find the right place right time so is you need to know which recruiters are hiring and apply only to those as compared to random recruiters and this can be only found if you just go and scrape the data of all the active events for example on Luma doai that's one of the favorite website I use on Luma you can see all the Bay Area events and see who are coming and this is this is like you know these are the recruiters or these were the people who were there to make awareness about the company and they definitely want Engineers so apply to those companies with these names of recruiters and the chance that be higher to hear back and last thing I you know I tell people you have to have something related to the hype currently Cloud engineering is at the biggest hype as you can imagine because Distribution Systems and this knowledge is highly demand because of AI AKs kubernetes and you know these uh these Services which deploy these llms on different different data centers and this can be okay and uh and U this distributed system just kubernetes you know distributed system like kubernetes Docker all of these skills connected with cloud computing can help you the most so you can go to Cod cloud and learn those Azure AWS as well as gcp on the same platform immediately so that'll be it go to cloudcloud don't forget to check out code cloud in description below and thank you so much for watching

not just happen faster but in the cloud with everything set up thanks to even Nims right Nvidia inference microservices every product that you use today has some form of generative AI so do you want to stick to just one AI app or just do you want to use generator a within all the existing apps so so there are two uh stages in any llm development pipeline one is in uh training and the second is inference there's a multiple step in order to like optimize a large language model to be production ready so hello everyone today we are in Nvidia office again we have Jay here who is expert in llms at Nvidia and we will be talking about what he thinks about the switch in the workforce especially For Engineers who are you know trained for years and years in data structures algorithms to prepare for big Tech there's an industry how we can evolve and prepare the engineers who are spending the full 100% from the age of 18 to 22 to give their best in their college and to learn the best Technologies and especially lot of coming in AI at Nvidia Nims lot to break down so hi Jay can you please introduce yourself sure hi herur hi everyone uh my name is Jay I am a developer Advocate uh at Envia focusing on large language model so my job is to educate developers on how they can accelerate uh llm workflows on Nvidia gpus so uh my background is in computer science so I did my undergrad uh from uh University of Pune in computer science and then came to the states uh for my masters in computer science with a focus in machine learning so I did couple of uh internships at startup and uh before uh coming to Nvidia I was doing a research internship at BMW uh doing computer vision and deep learning uh so where I got to use Nvidia software specifically it was called Deep Stream So basically accelerating video uh based uh version based computer version U on gpus and I also got to try out their Nvidia djx station so it's a uh workstation that includes four workstation level uh gpus uh So based on that I got to interview at Nvidia it went well and I started as a product marketing manager uh for deep learning software so I did that almost for three and a half years uh working uh and launching deep learning software uh so that was fun so I got to see the marketing side of software and I also got to work on Keynotes uh where our uh Jenson or CEO of Nvidia Jensen uh tries to showcase the latest and greatest at the Nvidia Flagship uh conference called GPU technology conference so uh but I wanted to be more Hands-On and more uh teaching oriented so that's why I took this role uh where I get to do some fun stuff and I really want to get to know you what what what are your goals here at Nvidia career-wise what do you think about what's happening what are you catching up to in llms gen correct correct yeah talking about uh goals I so I am a a passionate Tech Enthusiast I like Tech so I grew up watching all the Keynotes so uh working at Nvidia that was one of my goals about how how the keynote Cycle Works uh so I got to be part of it so that was fun but throughout the pro proc I was uh work working as a product marketing manager I was trying to see how can I communicate the new features uh to developers and part of which I was trying to come up with various strategies like will a blog or a video help with understanding this feature uh well to a developer I felt like I could be a educator as well and that's how I switched uh from product marketing manager to developer Advocate where I get to do all those stuff which is teaching uh through creating blogs uh creating technical videos and then going into conferences uh giving technical talks and teaching how a technology works and how I can help them uh and your blogs have reached like you know and have been cited in top research papers now yes yes yeah so that that has been my main motivation about educating uh developers and researchers on how they can um make their pipeline or research better by using Nvidia GP how did you figure out your passion for llms and how you got good at them correct so I think the passion for a deep learning started in my undergrad so back then there was a course called uh uh celf driving car Nano degree from Udacity and I was super passionate about deep learning because it was magic back then like understanding what's in the image that was great and taking it to a step further understanding how cell driving cars work and what are the algorithms behind it and it was mostly computer vision core computer vision and deep learning so that was my motivation and I enjoyed that uh aspect because it is also some form of art as well like figuring out like what should be the learning rate of the deep noodle Network and things like that so that was fun for me and that's how I got into deep learning uh and then llm as llm was evolving uh our team was also looking for someone who could educate developers about uh all the great stuff happening in the ecosystem and how how can they do it on gpus so I was like I'm up for it I I want to do it yeah how it has evolved what has fascinated you the most what are you catching up to now I think the earlier uh the notion was in the market that it it is based on my understanding and my opinions that U model were getting bigger and better better and that was the notion that bigger is always better but as the time has evolved I think people are also trying to go towards a smaller model because running big models like trillion parameter or like billion uh upwards of 500 billion parameter is not sustainable uh uh on a production scale right so you need lots of compute lots of electricity uh yeah a lot more money what are the three biggest things you have learned by being in Nvidia and in AI space first of all uh everyone here is aware about what uh what is going in the ecosystem like everyone is up to date and everyone you talk to knows about what are the latest model in the ecosystem how are they different from each other so everyone has a technical understanding about how these thing works uh the second learning I think everyone is humble here uh uh talking specifically about Nvidia everyone is super smart but they are also vulnerable or just try to give their best so it inspires you in a way that uh everyone is giving their uh like more than 100 person so it inspires and people are crazy smart here so it also helps uh talking about uh the AI industry I think it is evolving and specifically I like how uh everyone is trying to use generative AI as part of their daily life uh I I can give an example of mine so dayto day I use a lot of generative a I I don't think so I can uh go back to the earlier World pre uh llm or generator AI for example uh we have uh uh generative AI licenses Enterprise licenses so I try to brainstorm or just try to uh make progress on my scripts or just try to see how can I make this uh process better by just having a chat with an llm also uh in my daily life I use uh uh personal messaging apps and they also include now nowadays with integration with llm so I it just a tap away that is has been helpful for example if I need to go to a trip I just can ask hey give me a packing list also I I drive a Tesla which has a FSD so I can never go back uh driving manually or just uh focusing I just tried to use FSD it's so good so I think generative AI uh or AI in general has become a good chunk of my life and I think I can't imagine my life without it right and everyone focus in AI about the future I really want to talk about the present can you share what are the challenges you see right now and what problems you would like to solve being an AI being an engineer yes I I think uh specifically from the adoption of AI standpoint I think people are still trying to use how or still trying to understand how they can incorporate AI or llms as part of their daily workflow uh so there there are ton of tools for developers like co-pilots uh for improving their uh coding workflow or coding uh pipeline but I think people are still experimenting uh nobody has come to a conclusion that hey this is the best llm this is the best product uh to accelerate your uh coding uh so I think the same with I feel like companies are still trying to understand uh how they can use generative AI as part of their product and also empowering their Workforce so I think it is still work in progress I think maybe next year we might have better understanding about how this goes uh so so just my understanding or just my intuition so it's a very open field there's like you know no set path created for one problem correct you have to figure out you have to yeah it's a cat and mouse game right as people say yeah yeah I think every product that you use today has some form of generative AI so do you want to stick to just one uh AI app or just do you want to use generative AI within all the existing apps so but they don't share context with each other so that also might be a problem but I think yeah we are still figuring it out excellent so you have worked on the product side engineering side and you were in machine learning computer version from the beginning so can you share what is the difference between machine learning deep learning we used to do before the llm era versus now correct that's an interesting question I think uh uh the Deep learning era started with computer vision and that is where I think Nvidia GPU uh were explored or I think it was known that it works well with the AL Alex net uh introduction so I think before llm era there used to be lot more work around creating your application for example if you had to create a chart board there has there had to be much more work that uh needed to be done uh in order to fine tune uh the B model uh the B model from Google break it break it down yes yes so B so if you had to uh if you had to create a chart bot you had to uh first if if there's a response from a customer so you had to understand the text by breaking it down by removing all the stop words like the unnecessary Words which computer doesn't need to know like the uh in so you need to remove those then you need to understand the intent about what the intent about that phrase is so uh there was entity entity CL entity classification models that you were done and based on that you had you were coming up with a use case which was structured or which was just one of the five use cases in a customer uh Service chat bot so that is how the pipeline work but with the introduction of llm it just knows what so it understand the language so well that it can just directly answer like what is the use case that customer is looking for so you don't need to do all the pre-processing that was uh needed to be done in the pre llm or Transformers era and we have spreed up to a level that you know um those pre-training can now not just happen faster but in the class cloud with everything set up thanks to even Nims right Nvidia inference microservices that's the latest greatest that Nvidia released 2 years ago I watched the keynote big fan of Jensen hang how simplified simplified explanation he gave of nimes correct how would you explain names to the audience who are Engineers correct and who don't know anything about it yeah that's uh that's interesting and yeah I was part I went to the keynote uh saw it live it was amazing uh just that but uh so there's two ways so so there are two uh stages in any llm development pipeline one is in uh training and the second is inflence so training uh for training uh Nvidia has Nemo which we'll uh talk in depth later but focusing on the inference aspect inference is difficult or uh deployment is difficult and the reason being is so the all the models that you get uh for example uh model from llama 3.1 the latest model so they they have open weights available on hugging fees but you cannot just take those uh model weights and do start inferencing it is good for just a proof of concept or a demo but at the production scale it's not good because uh running that model would not get you the throw put that it requires for any production use case so all those models are in fp6 Precision so there are various Precision um uh uh available in deep learning so one of them is FP p16 which is floating 16 so which what does that mean is the number that are stored and computed are in floating 16 Precision so it is a 16 bit it would have like decimal level uh numbers which would be computed uh also during matrix multiplication and the problem with that is it is good for foundational model uh training or building but it is not good for inference because it requires much more compute uh at the inference side of things and to tackle that problem uh uh the usual method is to do quantization basically uh converting all the fp16 weights uh and activations to a smaller uh Precision in this case it could be integer 8 so it is integer only and 8 bit but you lose the decimal numbers uh in inate uh representation but there are various ways you can preserve uh those uh numbers or preserve the quality or the accuracy of the model by doing various kinds of techniques and uh but the upside is now you are not doing decimal computation so it is lot more easier and the numbers that are being uh computed or calculated in matrix multiplication it's just integer only so think of is like 7 8 9 so multiplying 7 into 8 is much easier than uh multiplying 7.12 3 into 8.6 3 4 so that's an example so uh that is one of the optimization that you can do to make the model run faster and then there's other optimization so you see there's a multiple step in order to like optimize a large language model to be production ready for inference for inference for inference right so uh Nim tries to uh make that process simpler by take making it easier or uh making it automatic for the developer so Nvidia uh the full form of name is NVIDIA inference microservices so you uh the idea is to uh you can basically get a microservice optimized container for any open source model that you can find on build. nvidia.com so there's almost I think there's two ways to access them so one is uh you can basically get uh or generate an API key like open AI and then basically use a open source model which is optimized and running on nvidia's cloud hosted infrastructure so uh for a for a free user I think you get th000 credits or th000 API calls for if you have an Enterprise account you uh or work email you get 500 uh 5,000 credits and but if you want to run that locally on your uh GPU so there's also a Docker container which you can uh basically follow the instruction on build. nvidia.com and just download it so once you download the docker container it starts executing it notices what is the uh Hardware that you are running so is it ampere based a100 is it Hopper based h100 and then it tries to download the optimized model for that specific hardware for your system and once it is downloaded the model is then uh hosted for inference and it gives gives you out a API endpoint which you can hit to uh get inference request or inference queries uh back so it is uh and it is easy to accommodate or just integrate that into your existing pipeline because it has a open AI API compatible server so if you are using open a API you can just try switching um uh with Nims and you should be good to go so let's say a company x correct they buys Nvidia Hardware h100 correct there is lot of training to use that Hardware which is $30,000 lot of training needed to you know use that hardware for any model for inference correct and to do it locally on that Hardware correct because you want to keep the data private correct now that has become easier with using the Nim microservice correct and now with that architecture you can do it on nida's website on the cloud and have it ready API ready model ready and you can use it privately there is that right yeah and it is all optimized and developer doesn't have to do anything so it brings the deployment time from weeks to uh several minutes in some cases or just days yeah excellent and what future you think it has changed for companies in terms of profits and in terms of employees needed to run a company correct that's a good question so in that case I think it helps uh employees spend less time on optimizing and just more time in iterating model and just deploying it so uh the reason being uh if you are just using the traditional way which is which is good if you so if you are if you have a really huge scale and any uh any inference time saved or through latency time save brings you millions of dollars then it makes sense to spend more amount of time in optimizing your model for your own use case but if you are just using open source models uh then you can just use this uh brings the deployment time uh significantly and yeah I think brings I think makes them more productive and uh being more iteration heavy than than just uh spending so much time on a single model optimizing overall for developers it is saving a lot of time because let's say at the end of the day LM llms are just like math multiplication let's say linear algebra multiplication or you know matrix multiplication earlier if there are two matrices like 3x3 Matrix 3x3 Matrix two multiplied in two functions a * B 8 * 7 and 6 * 5 correct both happening in a different function now you can happen both can happen in the same function in a simplified way like forgetting about the floating point if was 7.5 * 6.5 we can simplify it to 8.7 all the simplified process can happen in nvidia's inference microservice correct so it saves a lot of time in compute for for an engineer correct you mentioned Nemo framework as well which is so big part of nvidia's Foundry as Jensen hang says that you know data centers are The Foundry they are the system you provide bread and butter for these llms to work and function that's basically The Foundry is right that's how Jensen H explains it and Nemo is very big part of it explain what Nemo is and how it impacts developers okay yeah so Nemo is nvidia's open source generative AI framework where you can build develop and train uh fine tune uh Speech AI uh language based and vision based uh models so it covers everything uh in the training aspect so uh and Nvidia gpus are a first class citizen or this library is built for NVIDIA gpus so all the things that you do as part of llm development is uh GPU accelerated from end to end uh for example uh the there are multiple components of Nemo framework so first is Nemo itself which helps with training but then there's also Nemo data curator so if you're trying to build your own custom large language model or build a foundational model or just trying to uh generate a data set for fine tuning you can use Nemo data curator which helps you generate uh uh data set but and process all the information from uh like which is internet scale kind of data and it is completely GPU accelerated and it is powered by uh Rapids CF so Rapids is GPU accelerated uh uh site of libraries which includes uh GP acceleration for pandas pyit lar and all those P py toch so p is covered by codn but rapid is specifically for data science and data is mainly data science like how can you do data processing on tabular kind of data so that was Nemo data curator uh Nemo also contains Nemo guardrails which is important nowadays so guardrails is an open source library library which helps you add guardrails to your uh llm application for example it will uh make sure that your llm application doesn't go out of uh the boundaries or set of boundaries that you have created for your application or it is making sure the response is toxic or uh it is it's not toxic and U there within the guidelines that you have provided or not it also makes sure that the answers generated are within uh the context uh that the uh question is provided so that was Nemo Gils then there's Nemo customizer as well which helps you do the fine-tuning aspect so there are tons of good uh components and that you can use to build and train large language model and of course for inference there's uh Nvidia inference microservices on NY lot to unpack there so let's say an engineer a developer wants to you know use an existing model how n helps in simple words correct correct that's a good step by step yeah that's a good question Nemo checkpoints or the Nemo the models that are trained with Nemo have a different uh uh different specification so I think the model trains with trained with pyo comes with PT kind of uh checkpoints whereas uh model trains with uh trained with Nemo comes with Nemo so it has different kind of uh training mechanism so it tries to make sure uh that you are using all the uh GPU resources that are available at your disposal uh including various kind of parallelism so if you have multiple gpus so how can you paralyze the training mechanism on multiple gpus so uh you don't have to work through whereas with other Frameworks uh GPU is supported but you need lot more expertise in order to paralyze that workload throughout the uh data center or the multiple gpus that you have and you provide this on Nims as well as so n is mainly for inference uh inference workload whereas Nemo is mainly focused for training and fine-tuning large language model okay so uh like starting from data processing to build uh for uh foundational large language models to fine tuning or customizing your model for your specific use case which could be Enterprise based or your customer related yeah excellent so Nemo accelerates the development of new models correct and Nims ACC Ates how you process data and inference quickly as quickly as possible correct yeah so think of training is um you can accelerate training with Nemo and inference with nyss excellent and I really want to ask you about fine tuning you mentioned that fine tuning is accelerated with Nemo right so basically what happens in fine-tuning is uh you provide a set of uh responses so question and answer you create that data set and try to uh create a layer on top of existing open source model and try to like uh influence the weight in such a weight and activation layer in such a way that it learns like what are the question and answers and what is the correlation between them so it tries to understand uh with the data set that you have provided uh with qu question and answers it learns that and it can can answer the question directly um whereas with I think the other option is using rag so but with rag they uh the llm has to like understand uh what the uh what the whole context or the whole document is about and then come up with answer I see what do you see in 20year Old Engineers who want to be part of your team in AI what skills you would like to see in them I think uh uh llms or generative a a has become so good nowadays that you can solve any problem uh by just uh chatting uh with that AI so uh which means that you lose the motivation to understand what is happening uh like how does the neural network work uh what are uh how does learning rate impact the model training process so things like that I feel like uh people or students should spend more time understanding what goes behind the scenes or what are the foundations of large language models and there are tons of courses out available out there from Nvidia from other uh uh other platforms like deep learning. so I uh I recommend taking those course in and really understanding like what's the math behind it because I've seen some people don't like the math and just uh shut off uh learning AI or deep learning and then go to uh software engineering so uh but I think that is uh that is helpful to understand how uh models works that uh that is impacts your model usage or how you uh fine-tune the model or how you uh uh engineer The Prompt in such a way that you get your desired results if if you don't have that understanding then uh it makes uh makes it hard at the latest stage when you're doing the job and then you might need to like just go back and learn that again so I would focus like uh understanding the basic and or the foundation before just jumping on it what technical skills you would want in them in the Engineers okay okay so that's a good question I think awareness of all the tools uh open-source tools available out there like uh pie torch hugging face like you should know how to use them and uh if you want to train a model like what tool would you use uh if you want to fine tune a model what are the uh techniques to fine tune and what are the uh uh Frameworks or libraries are out there uh to use uh to do the fine-tuning process can you can you name some yeah so far fine tuning you can use uh hugging face uh it has a tool uh called Laura I think there's a function called Laura uh for uh Nvidia also has a Nemo customizer within Nemo faor uh so then that was that and then for training you can use py I I think you can use hugging face as well uh Nemo of course so I think there are tons of tool I think first having awareness and then maybe pick one uh out of of all the available tools and then trying it out on your own data set or just trying uh try building a demo project in order to like learn all this stuff what projects you would like to see in the resumés that you will hire for AI teams okay okay that's an interesting question so I I don't like generic projects like chat llm chat Bots or rag I feel like uh those are easy to reproduce or recreate like anyone can do it after taking a course I feel like uh people or students should try to look a problem in their daily life uh that they have been facing and try to build a solution using llms and then maybe uh just come up with a project which can live on GitHub uh so what would you build if you were in their place 22 year old I feel I I would like to create a Chad bot like her which has uh her the movie Her the most popular yeah yeah yeah not the romance aspect but just uh managing the daily life like uh today's my appointment with my uh physician or an appointment with my AO uh optometrist so things like that uh uh uh the AI should be able to like remind me that hey I need to I have a flight tomorrow so please check in currently I think those tools are there but uh these are disintegrated having a one single tune or one llm which has the context of your calendar or maybe what are the upcoming appointment trips and things like that so that might be a fun uh project yeah that I would work on excellent explanation of what student should make I think her project is definitely doable in today's world with the resources now how you got good at llms and how you became llm expert at Nvidia correct so uh I already had a deep learning background through my uh undergrad in Pune yeah Pune yes so uh not specific Ally from the uh University but I was doing courses on the side and also coming to the states I did uh my masters uh in CS but it was focused on ML and I got to do bunch of internship throughout my time so it was all deep learning so I had my deep learning uh Basics covered uh but for llms I think it wasn't that hard going from uh deep learning to llm side of thing because uh I already had the understanding of Transformers U mainly coming from BT models but it was just a uh little different in the llm space so I took a bunch of courses available out there uh like uh student word from corsera uh and other uh learning platforms so that was my introduction and I as I was ramping up I I did some projects uh tried to understand how the all the tools work in the ecosystem and just tried uh running uh those on gpus so I did nothing basically took the examples that are that were given the courses or in the GitHub repositories from the tool makers or Library providers uh and just uh run them and try trying them on gpus and yeah what what's your most impactful work in llm uh that defines you as an expert okay okay that's an interesting question okay so uh I recently I worked on a multimodel AI rag uh project uh so uh the video is live on Nvidia developer YouTube channel so if someone wants to go in and see how it works so feel free to but yeah so it basically creates a uh multimodel AI rag pipeline or rag agent which can answer question uh based on your PDF PowerPoint presentation which can include charts plots uh images so so it extends uh rag with multimodal capabilities ingesting all uh various kinds of PDFs PP uh PPT popo presentation so excellent I think rag based pipelines had been very limited you know it was just Tech space and multimodality is excellent and what else if you'd like to name uh yeah so I am working on few more projects which I can't name but uh yeah stay tuned what what future you see with LMS and rag based systems right now so I feel like uh rag uh rag will evolve uh with of course the new direction is multimodal uh capability I think there's ton of research going on there uh the other thing with rag I feel like uh this model the smaller models will be much more useful so as the models are getting smaller it is easy and efficient to run rag pipelines so if model is good at reasoning I think that should be good enough to uh connect with the external data source or database and get the pipeline running than uh having a model which is Big which is which has the World Knowledge but uh in a Enterprise setting for this particular use case that World Knowledge isn't relevant right so just using a smaller model which has good uh reasoning capabilities connecting uh that to a large uh database or Source uh Source data uh of Enterprise I think that would be a good use case uh the other thing that I see is uh I think local co-pilots as uh as the model are getting smaller uh there's ton of optimization that uh can be done and if is being done which is making uh making them run on small devices like laptops and phones nowadays so I think that is a good Next Step that we are heading into so that we don't have to send our data to a server you can just run the models locally on uh a smartphone or laptop and get the results what are the challenges you see in your day-to-day life in llms and what misconceptions people have of you around you correct uh so uh talking about challenge is I feel like this uh the the field is moving so fast that it's sometimes hard to keep up what's happening and just uh trying to understand like I think there was a time uh in one or two weeks there was announcement of three or four open source models and then there was also uh Tech bunch of research or techniques that were was uh announced or released by few companies that how to make uh the context length bigger and better for model so I think in that case it's really hard to uh uh hard to understand like what thing should I focus on or also uh I'm also thinking about how can I educate about one technology to our developers right so picking one technology out of the spectrum uh becomes hard and also keeping up with it is also hard but I think I have my uh setup uh which has been helping me uh so I just try to follow a bunch of folks on Twitter and just try to see what they have posted or what uh what's new and what's better so that's uh one thing or one challenge I think uh also uh uh I I'm producing videos now so uh generating or producing videos uh is a new skill for me so that is new uh but your sessions I've have seen some of your sessions on YouTube yeah you you you teach pretty well about LMS and especially that rag project I think our our CEO says that uh you shouldn't be afraid afraid of AI I think you should embrace AI uh which means that you you should be able to or you should try to learn all these generative AI tools uh uh which improves the productivity of a developer or anyone using it so that they become super human and be Irreplaceable so that's a thing uh that uh I follow I think just Embrace this try to see how can I improve my workflow uh by using all these tools uh and get more productive rather than just avoiding it and being scared out of it the biggest misconception of any AI engineer is the fear they bring in the life of Engineers but but I think you know Jensen W says the in the best way that Engineers will no longer be Engineers they will become super humans or super Engineers right one thing I've seen in llms that is lacking is that let's say I want to customize for my own use case let's say I have an English paper I wrote you know for my students and 50 students submitted it correct every different model like of competitors like meta Google anthropic they all can give different points some give 9 out of 10 10 out of 10 11 out of 10 but if I want a system in AI I want to give let's say based on grammar I want to find fine tune it and put a criteria if grammar is excellent give 10 out of 10 and if let's say ke if if let's say the wording is not American English and British English deduct points I want to make my own metrics correct I cannot do that properly right now correct so what what you think the future is in this process driven development is that in the talks right now so I think there's three ways to approach this problem so the first or uh the easiest one is uh using prompt engineering so uh what does this mean is you uh create a prompt in such a way so descriptive that the model knows how to grade uh these uh uh questions or Answers by giving them uh by giving it a few examples about how would you do it so uh if this is the answer I would rate this as six is this is the answer so you create a basically a prompt before uh asking llm to judge or uh query or just uh submit a uh assessment for a question so that's the easiest way but the problem with this is it is not uh consistent yes that's the problem yeah and the second one is you are increasing the context length of the model so if you're running this at scale this might become a problem so the second one is you fine-tune the model uh using one of uh the techniques which is uh for example Laura so which is very efficient in terms of fine tuning so you basically create a data set about uh responses and grade so you create that data set and try to re uh try to train a model with those data set and get uh it will give you a fine tune model which you can use uh to assess and the third or the most uh uh I think expensive ways to create a foundational model from scratch just for this purpose so I think based on this I think the finetuning aspect uh just creating a data set about how would you rate uh answers I think that would be a better option and the tools are available out there like hugging face and it is also GPU accelerated so you can use openly or freely available gpus like T4 uh with I think that would support only a certain size of model uh but I think that will still will get you started right and a lot of Engineers watching me you know they think that llms are expensive NLP ways you know before llms are still cheaper than using an using like you know apis of these large langu models because for large scales they become still very expensive mhm so do you know some hacks or ways to reduce the cost per token or like to use a prompt that uses less tokens mhm mhm in LMS okay okay okay I think I feel like uh this is a prompt engineering question and it is more art uh than science but what I've seen is uh being descriptive helps and there are tons of courses out out there available on how you can uh create a a specific prompt that will get you I don't have any like specific answers but I think just try to take one of those courses uh but what I've seen is being descriptive really helps yeah what security risk and threats you see while building an llm using an llm inferencing an llm in all three stages I think uh mainly the security risk is at the deployment side uh I think one of the examples is prompt injection where you just basically ask a a customer chart board to do a non-customer service or use case and that uh in some cases it answers that question so I think it is much more uh recommended to have guard rails around your uh use case or uh deployment uh for which Nvidia has Nemo guard rails which helps you do that but there's are other open source tools available as well how does it work how do guard work so you basically uh try to see and judge all the queries that or the transaction happen between user and the llm and uh the Nemo guardrail tries to check if the response generated is within within the boundaries like it is not toxic and it or it is not going uh outside of the use case so there's multip like there's ton of documentation but it just makes sure that uh the llm response are generated without within a guard rail or within a boundary that the application is supposed to do and not go outside of Hardware G right no so these are not Hardware these are software uh so you basically H write a a specification about uh what what your needs are so there are various parameters uh so there's documentation available so security threats are more on the Infant side M so that we need to we need some guard rails so that we can protect the answer of that prompt comes related to what you asked and software level guard rails are Nemo is part of Nemo guard rails Nemo guard rails yeah now any other threats you see that we need to be cautious about for all the startup Founders watching this or AI Engineers watching this yeah I think just I think the Gil would be the most important uh thing for now all so uh I think there's there are various tools out there in terms of generative AI so I think we should be uh we should make sure that what kind of data is being sent uh to the clouds while processing if they are uh keeping their if they are keeping our data onto their servers or not so things like that should be uh more uh we should be more careful of using those tools awesome and I heard that there is NVIDIA conference coming up in India can you please share details on that yes yes yes yeah so uh there's a uh conference called Nvidia AI Summit uh that is upcoming in India uh it would be in Mumbai at the Geo uh World convention center and Jensen will be there uh having a fireside chat so and there will be ton of good sessions as well uh uh ranging from data processing uh to llms and everything in between so uh I would recommend your audience to join that and uh uh your audience will also get a 20% discount on the conference price uh so that I'll share it and you can put that into the YouTube description awesome thank you so much Jay it was wonderful talking to you learned a lot as always and I hope this video inspires more Engineers AI enthusiasts to devel to do development the right way thank you so much again using Nemo and Nims thank you again thank you for having me

and then suddenly AI boom started everyone was like okay now we have to work on AI and the easiest language to work in AI is uh startups preferring to work with react python because the problem is when you learn it you're not implementing it and if you're not implementing it's of no use don't you get bored by making the content I was like actually I get bored so I wanted to do something different in Python so what I did is I used lot of VFX can you share what point of time you thought of quitting your job because technical skills will take you somewhere networking skills will take you everywhere quitting your software job to become a content creator might be easier today but quitting your job and putting everything into your passion of teaching for 10 plus years is extremely difficult and today we will learn the success and the journey of telesco from which millions of us have learned programming spring boot Java and how he runs his startup in Bangalore a quick shout out to fly with Singh where you can first of all find all templates to study abroad plus expect a call back from a consultant so you can short list the universities you must go to and apply immediately go check out fly with sing right now so hello everyone today I am in the office of telescope the Channel that I learned from Spring boot cotland 2016 Trend that Google was making cotland its official language so first Channel that I learned Android development in goland was tusco so hi tsco thank you so much for having me we will learn how this channel became a startup in Bangalore and lot to learn from him so hi n thank you so much for having me can you please introduce yourself thank you so much uh so I'm nin Ry uh also called as telescope by some people I started my journey in 2001 that's my first video on YouTube uh and now we are running a channel which has almost 2.3 million subscribers now it's fun to get to see the number but challenges comes every day so recording videos uh having fun building different systems that's what I do now primary focus is on Java but also explored blockchain and now exploring going to explore AI uh and thanks for the motivation before this video I mean soon I'll be focusing on AI as well I stay in Bangalore so mostly we be having some questions on Bangalore as well awesome so first of all let's start with the Technologies which are getting outdated for example us that you know there was a hype of Open Source Big Data tools like spark like Hadoop they are outdated now because cloud is the future so things are changing really fast and uh I mean maybe Hado might be relevant for some companies but cloud is the biggest future like companies came like data brick Snowflake and right people are moving their data to these companies and Hardware is reaching data centers as compared to normal person doesn't need to create create a room full of of gpus room full of hard drives ssds deoy and it's much more convenient so can you can you share in in terms of your T stack out is it spring boot next which is going to get outdated what are the things getting outdated now in fact uh see there are things which actually get outdated and then there are things where people say it will get outed soon uh in fact in 2006 or 7 when I started learning Java and people were saying Java is getting outdated from 2007 2007 it's been 20 17 years now 18 years Java is still there and springboard is still in the market uh but yeah but there are certain Technologies which are changing very fast in terms of cloud you mentioned uh I remember 2014 uh I saw an ad in a newspaper a company was hiring a Hado developer and they were paying they ready to pay 4 KS package wow I was like I want to learn Hadoop now so why time and I was like okay first I will complete Java series I will learn had I will make Hado series because it's trending so much but you have to also understand as a company perspective in fact discuss you mentioned about companies focus on those things which are making profit go with J they can easily maintain it and uh the talent the resource people they can be example let's say if you are working on some project and then suddenly you you feel that I want to leave this job go go somewhere else they can't depend on techologies which you use they want to make it standard to manage they Outsourcing it in fact that's why we have thiss cultureel and it was magic at one point in fact I remember 20178 when I was exploring uh Amazon uh code star so Amazon also has their own pipeline uh the way we have GitHub they have code commit which is just got uh uh they have discontinued code commit three days back uh they also have the they have the entire Pipeline and for for me it was a magic I'm writing a code in Java I'm just saying saying sa save and commit in this machine automatically I can see the build in the server for a company it becomes very easy to manage people it becomes very easy to manage the softwares now coming back coming back to uh the Java Java and stuff uh 2010 was a boom period where Java was very famous again people were talking about it will get outdated but also when I saw the market Java was everywhere and then suddenly AI boom started everyone's like okay now we have to work on AI and the easiest language to work in AI is uh python so people like okay so we have to Learn Python then learn AI on the other hand uh when you got web development easiest way to build application now is Javascript you know those those were golden days where we used to learn different technology for different stack or different layers for front end learn HTML C JavaScript for the middle we you can learn c.net or Java or PHP for the backend database technology also have to master and then JavaScript people like no you know we should we know one language we want to do everything in that language I want to do frontend we got react I wanted to to back end we got nodejs expressjs we got we wanted to go uh database also in JavaScript so we got Json formats now mongodb so everything is Javascript now when you say things are outdated lot of people also say that angular is outdated not exactly uh the thing is they have different segments in the market we got startups preferring to work with react python because it's easier to find people who can work on that and startups they have the ideas right they have they want to implement that in a in a week so they will prefer a language where people know about the language and also it is easy to build on the other hand if you talk about the Enterprise Market they go with some stable stuff they don't have this idea okay today we got the idea tomorrow we'll Implement they go with a chain of process someone will have the initiate someone will take the initiation then someone will uh plan it some some other team will execute it and then they look for Technologies which are stable which will go for a long time and that's why they prefer stable languages like okay don't bash me on this but they prefer NET Framework they prefer Java in that stack it's not like they're not using node but then preferable is still Java and uh uh net Java you can also say cotlin because it is easier to work with cotlin than Java so yeah that's how the things are nothing is getting audited is just that different company have different approach to work with totally agree same with Cloud so for for example biggest preference for companies is AWS because let's say they have a they're already using AWS and most people know AWS because AWS doing the the most amount of conferences AWS is working so good on marketing they have the most number of services so it is easier to hire an AWS Cloud developer as compared to Azure as compared to gcp so that's why the highest number of profit is also number Al also made by AWS then Azure then Cloud so it's becoming you know it's becoming a bubble and it's expanding and Google and Azure are using other ways to compete so like whatever disadvantage advantage that is the strategy they use it's same like uh same like Advantage '90s if you know IBM was the biggest software company when it started 90s May and then uh they used to use database with nodes so for example uh let's say let say you have an account number let's say this is a bank this is account number it's a node and it will have a branch for name her Na and this is how databases used to work and SQL got invented and Oracle became the first company to implement IBM was slow so disadvantage orle Advantage now it's the bigger company bigger company in software now so I think that's how the cycle plays now in with IBM I remember IBM always starts something but they're not fast enough to move as I mentioned uh in fact Watson the AI platform for IBM they were like they're talking about Watson every everywhere but then suddenly other companies are coming up and they are taking away the market yeah so whatever some companies disadvantage you can start a company there and leaded right yeah now my big question is I think in our education system in Java the biggest challenge is Java is getting updated every year but coursework is not I go to colleges in Us in India both have have problem they still learning Java 6 7 8 we have Java 22 now true like Java I was using the last J version 18 so do you think is that okay what is lacking in Java education now uh I mean not just Java it's with most of the Technologies now in fact when I was doing my degree we Al we were also outdated then when I came to the market then I understood okay that was outdated there is something you have to learn it all depends upon the students now in fact when I go to different colleges I saw few colleges are taking effort so few colleges are autonomous so they have their own uh curriculum so they are trying to implement it example let's say uh the university says we have to teach Java 7 this colleges go for Java 11 or Java let's say 14 Max the problem is colleges cannot upgrade every year they can't actually they don't have this capacity of catching away technology in fact as an independent trainer I can't catch up with the Technologies like everywhere we are going so I'm focusing on blockchain now ai is booming if I go on AI something else will boom even I can't catch up so College are doing their best or maybe they're not even doing anything it depends upon it comes down to students now they have to understand this college is only for environment college is for you to go for a structure education but apart from it you have to also learn things which are happening in the market and don't just learn everyone talks about tutorial hell YouTube is one uh you go to YouTube you follow a Creator maybe multiple creators and then you say okay I will learn this I will learn that the problem is when you learn it you're not implementing it and if you're not implementing it's of no use I have learned a lot of Technologies in my last 20 years how many I remember now only thing which I work on so don't just learn things implement it and don't depend up on your college they they will never able to catch the market but still as a college if you if anyone of them listening to this um I would encourage you to connect with industry experts at least have have one session in a week from industry expert they will not teach they will come there and they will just talk about the things are happening in the industry so that students will know what to work on so they will go home they will we have the chat GP now we got Google so we have to motivate student to learn don't teach them motivate them that's very important and same I think they should come to Bangalore and go to Luma meetup.com cerebral Valley all of these meetups some are remote some are in person attend those and learn from industry people what is happen and then then they get more motivated I think in person motivation is 10x more true true now you started with a YouTube channel you start with the journey to teach people can you can you share what people already don't know so how did you start from mumbai's chw what were the challenges of building this YouTube channel and how you convert it to a startup so 2012 you graduated uh yeah in fact when I was doing my msse uh 2011 uhhuh so at that point I was responsible so in fact we had the system in our College we can train our Juniors so I was doing Masters we were responsible to train the Juniors uh and then at one time I can't talk about the college because they would feel bad but there's a problem that I I wanted to teach something to the students but then I I was stopped then I felt K as a trainer if I love teaching I should be able to teach to everyone and then I went home I recorded my first video because at that time YouTube was not it was more for c videos I can say education was not the main Moto of YouTube to views I was demotivated or plus record is a big challenge now at least I have a good Studio I got a camera at that point recording video in that one room where you have a one bed T so you have to stop them I can record the video so I was finding it challenging supp4 uh my wife when she was my girlfriend we were discussing about what else we can do uh apart from so we wanted to build a product look at the Indian tech Market we were hardly having good trainers I can teach so I will start uploading videos we were thinking about different names example one of the name which came out is nain skills but then I don't want my name with the channel based on company I can't sell my name so we wanted to go for some unique names so Tesco came into picture or Fe we started uploading videos what does Tesco mean Tesco is a telu word which means get to know so I'm T I don't speak telu much but then I wanted to go for my mother tongue so is get to know then I started uploading videos again crowd but I was happy com after six months of uploading videos I got a comment because of this video I got the job I was like okay I'm not getting money from YouTube but at least I'm helping people so that was my first motivation and slowly stud I got I got messages from different countries uh one of my initial subscriber I think shabir is was his name uh he used to message me on LinkedIn or different platforms uh I watched your videos uh you know I've learned a lot from them but I I'm confused with this topic I was like okay I got the new content so I started uploading videos on those things which he was he wanted to learn he wanted to pay me but then I thought not a good time to pay now let's see later but that's how we started I started uploading videos 2016 came and then uh you mentioned about cotlin uh Google announced that they are making apart from java they can also use cotlin is the official language for Android it was 9:00 a.m. I got to know and I thought now people will come to learn cotlin so 11:00 a.m. we recorded the video by round two we uploaded our first video wow in a week I uploaded the entire series I was like channel was here it went there 2018 again AI hype hype was there uh people wanted to Learn Python in fact I went live on YouTube and I was talking about something and people like teach python teach python I was like I'm not into python I love Java they're like no I we want to Learn Python I thought let me try how difficult it can be to learn a new language so I learned python in one week I started uploading video but then you mentioned right before the uh before this video that do don't you get bored by making the content I was like actually I get bored so I wanted to do something different in Python so what I did is I used lot of VFX not exactly the high level VFX but then using green screen at that point it was new 2018 was lot of people were not using green screen for the videos I used green screen animations on the screen and one video was taking one day to edit and I recorded around 100 videos so the entire 6 months I was making python videos and that was fun it took time but it was fun and channel was here after Cartland two years python took it somewhere else and then I came to know that people want to learn it's just that when they want to learn something they want to I me it's it's our job to make it interesting right how do you keep them engaged because nowadays because of Instagram and all those tools we don't have patience we want to see things in 5 seconds if you don't like it swipe how do we make it interesting for a tutorial where you're talking about let's say doing a login form using python how do you make it motivating so that's the thing I was trying to do uh then uh at one point I wanted to explore different Technologies I had a team because initially yesterday I was doing my uh content creation recording editing I was doing by myself at one point I thought I need people so I started hiring people for editing then for Content creation for managing the company and uh supporting the Audi because we have we done different courses on on on our platform so we wanted to provide support to them so in that case the company grew up not the initial plan I don't I'm not a people person where I can manage people I can I can actually but I realized when I started managing people I can't work on my own things because making a video creating content is a creativity work and if you are into creative work you you want people to leave you alone and if you get a call we have to talk we have to discuss about this things you get distracted so now I try to avoid it but again if you run a company you don't you don't have a choice so yeah balancing life between employees YouTube and family so lot of uh people in tech industry talk about quitting their job for content creation for the startup in Bangalore so can you share what point of time you thought of quitting your job was it when YouTube Revenue went same level or above it above your full-time job okay good question because again the same year 2016 uh before CTL so what happened is I was uh doing uh trainings I was doing a lot of trainings in different companies I left my software job because I I used to love teaching and I got to know that training gives me more money than in software development and I got into training I was making good amount of money in 2016 and then when I saw the YouTube stats it was looking good so I was rning 10% of what I I was making as a a corporate trainer uh and then I thought okay this is good but then when I looked at my YouTube videos I was uploading videos once in a week and then I used to you I used to look at the comments they saying waiting for the next video I want to learn this topic I was not able to manage making videos and doing corporate trainings then I the day I I I thought okay what if I can make one video or two videos per day can I survive with the revenue from YouTube I thought I can't but I do have a saving so I switched I stopped doing any all the trainings in fact I was doing uh seven to eight trainings per year came down to one training per year and then currently I'm also doing training one one training per year just to be in the market just to go there just to meet people uh I stopped doing training I was only focusing on you for two years I was surviving with one/ tenth of the revenue of what used to make so my expense was almost above than what I was getting almost 10 times yeah so you took a risk right but what what is Corporate Training can you explain uh so the thing which I do on YouTube I used to do in corporate so example when companies hire different candidates and they have a project on Java they have a project on which is springboard or python so I go there to teach them different Technologies so it's more of a consulting job where you have to also talk about the curriculum what so some companies they have the reded curriculum this is what you have to teach some companies they say we have this project we have this candidates you have to take them from here to there you decide what you want to teach but just make them ready so it was fun yeah I've seen even in big companies Amazon Microsoft meta uh all the we big companies uh even even like you know Google has their learning platform where they teach their own employees because they use their own tools so they do online sessions online recordings so it's something similar right kind of similar yeah similar okay now what are the real challenges of running a startup in Bangalore I can tell you the real challenges of San Francisco and San Jose is they call it man Jose they they they struggle with finding girls in the city this just people talk about it's just Tech and less job market for people who don't want jobs in Tech so is B Bangalore you think similar is it like Mangalore or Bangalore you can say Mangalore because in fact in Tech in general when you talk about tech uh the male ratio is much higher than female ratio uh there are several reasons to it but then we have to change it we have to motivate uh women in Tech and most of the companies are doing that that's a good initiative they are taking uh apart from that one of the challenges is the cost in Bangalore it's much higher in fact I was born by in Mumbai to and people say that Mumbai is very costly compar if you talk about Indian cities they used to think Mumbai is the costliest one then we shifted to Bangalore and now the things are changing I am finding Bangalore is much costlier than Mumbai uh that's one that's one issue uh another issue is lot of tech people are there in Bangalore that's a good thing for me because when I go out when I used to go in go out in Mumbai let's say there's a chance that at least one person will recognize me in Bangalore it's more so I know when if I go to a market at least one person will be there who will say I've seen you somewhere is it the same guy I'm not sure maybe I look different in real life compared to YouTube uh so those are the good things but also challenge because we have lot of tech people and since we have lot of tech people that there's lot of money in Bangalore since there a lot of money in Bangalore the cost is going up but running a startup is always difficult doesn't matter the city is managing people is one of the biggest thing of especially finding good talent and okay there are two things one Talent is important but also their mindset some people are talented but they don't don't want to work much and there are people who are not that talented but they give their heart out to work on your project so I prefer the person I'm second category it's okay when if you're not that good with Talent or the technology you should be excited to work it's like the same principle like high Fast Fire fast like you know cicon Valley has the same it's very very fast goinging okay and in terms of the cost of course Mumbai I when I travel in Mumbai and travel in Bangalore I feel the difference challenge which tech industry people talk about is that Apartments like maybe it's very expensive 20 30,000 rupees they will take 6 months of security deposit of your rent and or in the same city people with 3 lakh rupees package a year and one CR rupees with three four years of experience are able to cope up and what are the challenges when there is that much pay differences in the same city in fact we had the same discussion before moving to Bangalore the good thing is we are living outside Bangalore so the cost is not that high compared to city and I've seen lot of employees they share the rooms so example they share one or two BK Max so difficult to survive withs in Bangalore but look manage there now last what is the future of telescope when is since it is a startup what are what students can expect in the next few years so there are two things which we are doing now one uh I have spent lot of time teaching lot of time spending on YouTube I've observed one thing when you talk about trainers I have seen all amazing trainers in the world because I'm I'm a corporate trainer I meet them and when they go into classroom in 5 10 minutes the students are like wow but the same person when they come in front of camera they struggle because they don't know how to teach to a camera so one of my aim in next few years is teaching how to teach or sharing my experience how I came came from corporate world to the camera world uh next we are planning to launch some more products enough of teaching more of uh products to help students in terms of uh now we have all this platform right lead code and all the stuff apart from it I want to focus on some product where they can learn building projects not just building small applications big projects working in a team because when you join a company you have to work in a team and what they don't learn Now is working in a team uh even if you do a course you're learning it alone you're not you're not going to work alone in a company so we want to build that system where at the start itself they can they will learn how to work in a team how to work work on a big project and what are the issues they can find in the industry to solve it and you get a bootstrap all the way everything is Bo strap so we there's a point when we thinking about uh getting funding we we might get funding but the problem is once you get funding investors have lot of say to what you should do and I'm the not kind of person who can go with the invest investor way I have my own plans and we are making enough money so that we can implement it awesome and what would be the final advice for students because AB what people have told me that AB currently in Bangalore 80% jobs are software which are booving much more poaching happening LinkedIn software it is the boom of software era in Bangalore and now slowly it's 20% AI it's going to move more into AI so what advice you would give to students so that they can catch up okay one thing very important uh as I mentioned before don't just learn things implement it it's very important right so it doesn't matter how much you learn it's first thing you have to implement stuff go with the trending one uh example AI is there now focus on AI maybe you don't want to master not everyone is meant for AI uh you can learn AI in two ways one actually learning Ai and second is how to use AI uh what is booming more is how do we use AI to implement our own stuff nowadays uh but very important Implement and learn new things also go to different events we were discussing about different events as you mentioned about different platforms the only thing which I was using is meetup.com but uh hu mentioned some of the AI I mean event uh websites go there attend the events network with people very important because technical skills will take you somewhere networking skills will take you everywhere so make sure that you improve your communication and networking skills wonderful and it's better to be a jack of all trades rather than master of one because that's better than than master of none yeah thank you so much naen it was very nice meeting you learned a lot and please check out his channel as well we' have done another video and and we'll be in touch thank you so much thank you so much for begin sure

Wow! What an amazing view! So ready guys for Grand Canyon in Arizona Very excited! Ok ready? Ok Yeah, I'm ready too Yeah morning tiredness, I can see By the way, Had a bit bad experience in this Airbnb For example: Here tap is not working in Kitchen and let's close it, who knows when it'll turn on Tap is not working and wifi was very sketchy I had a presentation yesterday It was very stressful So they'll give a bit refund But yeah overall, it was a decent stay I would say Okay bye Let's go So, got our SUV ready for our dream trip Have you seen the movie? Yes In that there's song when when to goes to Vegas from Pheonix "Ye dil deewana" That's what exactly going to happen today Ok, let's do the Are you excited everyone? Because of morning, they are bit tired So just done with our lunch and And look at how our names My name is correct My name is pronounced and spelled correctly What about you Abhishek? You said Abhishek And they made it Amish And what about you I go by Marc I think you should say singh as well because Singh is king I think Marc works You look like you could be a Marc. Harnoor's bad jokes are so bad So now guys we're at Sedona Sedona is the name of city This is red rock state park of Arizona This is on the way to Grand Canyon Now can't believe if this is amazing then Like if this is amazing then Grand canyon will be epic. We have Arihander coming from San Francisco And we have Frank also from San Francisco So, is the life actually worth it because Its every computer science dream to be in Silicon valley How's the scenario in 2024? I think San Francisco is a good place to live I mean, a lot of people don't stay long It's kinda like You go there and there's new grad experience And it's a city that has a lot of extremes Like it's very expensive There's lot of homeless There's also lot of big attractive stuff to do Correct Beautiful areas like you know No, it sucks! Everything is closed at 2AM Everything's closed at 2AM Really! Yeah like That's so bad It's so terrible like There's this rule that everything has to be closed at 2am Oh god But why can't we have both! I'd say the restaurants and cafes Atleast for my kind of lifestyle But do you like the network, You both? Yeah, the tech network is strong Ok, no worries Now this is an amazing view Just filled the gas now Excited for Grand Canyon and Vegas So, these are deers? or reindeers or something? So guys, we have made it to Grand Canyon And the great Grand Canyon, Here we will see the sunset point Here is the most beautiful sunset point. So, excited for it It's at 10 min walk from here Till now we've just paid $35 for the parking So this is the point The epic sunset view! Oh wow! What an amazing view! It is known as the wonder of the world It is pretty good yes right I mean, it is epic and worth it So epic So compared to Canada which park comes closer to this Banff is very beautiful Its a different thing and different vibe You can't compare It is natural beauty That peak is very beautiful! Oh wow! We'll see the sunset right there when the sun will set We'll go there to see now Will have to walk there brother Sunset is hiding there Sometimes it is here We have to walk all the way to the peak to see sunset on that side Will have to fully go on that end We have to go all the way to that end How many national parks I've been to I've been to 3 in Washington Olympic In east, I've been to smokeys And Favourite is this? Obviously! I mean it has very good first time views. But one thing that I want to see here, which we will see tomorrow that Is there anything to do or it is just a view? That we'll get to know tomorrow Like how are the hikes and trails And how is the overall experience True, let's go there to see the sunset And by the way bro, You know there are thousands of caves here and It's whole size is even bigger than the Rhode island The state of Rhode Island Can you believe it! Size of whom? of this Great Canyon Its not that big bro! I'm serious, I read about it It's like 2000 sq miles Can you believe it? And not just this The temperature here, like somewhere is snow and somewhere there isn't because temperature ranges to upto 25 degrees here, up and down. One place to another It's not that big bro 2000 sq miles Can you believe it! No Its really epic! I didn't knew this much Yes It's like truly maginificant feeling But Rhode island is very beautiful This can be compared with Jordan's petra It's not less than that Amazing You made of Petra right? Yes I made There are so many amazing view points I mean its so big! See it 2000 sq miles and it's so big And can you believe? Even after all that This is not World's deepest cave More deepest than this exists but this is the biggest one. Where they exists?? Somewhere I think Will have to check that Bro, World's deepest cave exists in Georgia Athlanta? In Georgia country There it is even more deeper than 2000 sq miles This is less than 2000 Sorry, it is more in Georgia and lesser here How many national parks you've been to? This is my 2nd We went with you to Reineer When you were doing internship in Seattle in Meta That time It gets mixed up Wow Not visible because of that cloud Reflection of sun is coming there So cool. The moon looks so good and we staying in Grand canyon We're staying inside in this lodge So boys have checked in Yes!!! Room is ordinary Who am I sucking tonight So, who will sleep with each other? Don't put this in video I don't have any issue, I can sleep anywhere yeah, so size matters So bigger size with smaller size Guys, today was so much fun we had so much fun Let's come to reality from this hotel room because as engineers and common people We're surrounded by cyber security threats everywhere Whether it is companies in Vegas like MGM where they had loss of $100million because of one cyber security attack And similar is happening in Roku now All their data is leaked. So, to stay safe from these attacks. A simple hack you can use is by using a VPN Because with VPN, all of your data in your device and internet becomes encrypted. And you become anonymous No one can tell from which country you're And this simple hack can keep you secure in the world of internet That's why I use my favourite VPN called SurfShark because firstly, it allows me to use on unlimited devices. My android phones, my laptops, ipads everything Plus it allows me to have less subscriptions because because peacock, HBO, netflix eevrything asks for subscription With SurfShark, I can change country to India Get the store unblocked Plus to get youtube premium for 100rs a month almost which is India's pricing So, what are you waiting for guys So, full moon guys and you can see so many stars I see the sky full of stars I think it won't come in phone but it is so epic. I see the sky full of stars We woke at 6am to see the sunrise and again cloudy weather And its freezing yeah its freezing So I got burrito and a cup of hot milk. Hot milk? yeah I know hot milk is healthier. So, that's why Coffee has zero calories. yeah but milk will fill you up for the hike Caffeine is not like good for you Its better than cocaine When you visit cities then you realize that national parks are most b'ful here Yeah My goal is to visit all before 30. Till now, how much you've reached? 5-6 Show your passport to me also It doesn't have old stamps now, This is new one Really? The ones I have visited are not in it How many national parks are there in US? Like, there's a passport for it to keep track 50 something Oh wow So, you can put all the stickers there And I think this should be one of the top 10 atleast This is their visitors centre. There's a show as well This is how we get stamped Let's do the stamp Stamp on passport That's free so, first stamp is in And, here we go Oh yeah They change it everyday mar' 23 Oh really! yeah yeah It's like a country's stamp. From visitor centre we got to know the best hike trail. So we have decided to go to South so, that is around 4 hours And views for all are same but this is most popular one. And here are many vehicles of US govt. also And they have a different license plate So, we're taking this bus for the hiking trail It's not this one? See there's written Kaibab route So, hiking begins guys And majority people who die here You know how it happens I asked them, How many times accidents happen? Peak time is august People literally like be on this and then they're relaxing and this is fall off Oh, Be careful..Don't be on this edge And many accidents happen with the selfie stick too Like people have tripod and they get lost in vlogging In August month here, We were talking before They said "In august, 5 helicopters were actually 5 helicopters came in august month, You know that right? They had to fly them out straight to the hospital If you get bitten by the snake Then you have to pay $10k for that Antitode More like $30k But I mean, that's healthcare in the US for you They have the antitode, a lot of countries don't have that Yeah So, you'll get the antitode but it's like $30k Helicopter's cost and ambulance cost is $800 one way and lot of costs. If you get bitten by a snake, so be careful very careful Have to be very careful And what cons it has, please tell those also Audience must know this Most are rattle snakes and here is that also Let me just tie my laces Let me tie my laces. Here is rattle snakes and scorpions also. There's a lot here And just in case, Snake bites you then what we'll do Then helicopter will come and take me It is really epic hike The view is very nice. So amazing But have to be careful walking Need to be very careful I also read that the height is so big that half of the people get heart attack So they die in between and then they land. And remember guys, this is a desert At the end of the day, you have to drink lots of water Everywhere check points will come, So I have two bottles with me And hike is of 4 hours Like yeah, Oh my god! And once again, it is unbelievable to imagine that Like this walk is so long that it is so long that it is even longer than a state of US Longer than Rhode Island Bigger than Rhode Island in sq m area as well as in length. Can you believe it too? yeah, that's crazy And those who are curious that how it was formed It was formed through colorado river It was all water and then dried up and led to the formation of the Grand canyon Like going is so easier because you're on the right side. But while coming back, people were stopping for us Because when people walk on the left side, it is very scary. Coming back is gonna be scarier, we're gonna be on the edge. If you slip, you're done Yeah basically. Here, the weather difference is a lot 25 degrees change up and down. It's a lot of temperature change around the Grand Canyon It's hot now and it was cold up there. Oh gosh! Don't do that On the way back, you can have horses I guess. So this is the Ooha point Wow, we came from all the way top till here. Half of the way is done A lot is still left So, dangerous with the wind. We're here on such good trail. And such views, they're seeing first time and it is going to be their last time also I mean you can take an Indian out of India but you can't take India out of them Oh be careful! Don't fall back Don't fall back You're right The view is amazing Oh wow SO, that is end That is end and there is colorado river part. So, next checkpoint guys If you want to hike more From there river is also visible but not worth it, its just mud So, we're just stopping here Till here is 110 sq m elevation So, it'll be very difficult to go up. But if you go down its less elevation which is 900 but its not worth it. They said its not worth it to see the mud and river If you want another one hour down and two hours up. Just got to know that this is also 1100 elevation Too much Wow What a hike! We can get very nice picture here How you feel? We finally did it guys Energy is back Back to earth Line for bus to go home. Totally worth it, It was so much fun Was lot of fun, right? It was so much fun! I think we should just drive Good choice Good choice We're in line, finally its so long Line is so big! Frank brother has gone to touch them. Long line now and then directly food and then next Vegas Great trip to Grand Canyon Vegas is four hours from here. Anyone who comes here, I would say it's really worth it Hike is a bit difficult But if you can do then definitely come Even if you can't still come and try as much as you can. And don't go too down as well. because while going down you don't get to know like how much down we're And then its difficult to come up. Then it is difficult Go only that much deep, how much you can afford.

Friends, in India, a student can go to a med school right after their 12th grade. But in USA you have to do Pre Med for four years in order to go to a med school So that's why today I decided to challenge pre med students in Johns Hopkins University with our most difficult medical entrance exam called NEET. And the rules were pretty simple. 3 questions in 3 minutes. From physics, chemistry or Biology. So this is an exam from our Indian Medical entrance exam. So we are given 180 questions- around 200 questions to be done in 180 minutes. And what's your favourite subject by the way? - Probably Chemistry. - So this has Physics, Chemistry, Botany and Zoology. By the way, would you like to introduce yourself? Oh, I am Crystal and I am a chem major a pre med. I will hopefully go to Med School. Oh, so it's just pre med, right? So you do 4 years pre med and then 4 years med school, right? How do you feel about the paper so far? I am a first year med student so I haven't learned a lot of it. So it's just scary looking through this. What did you say the topics are? The topics are Chemistry, Physics, Botany and Zoology. 2 categories of Biology. So we are supposed to do this in our 12th grade because we don't have pre med. So this is our like- High school stuff. Botany? Yeah, I mean, you can just Botany, I think. That could be... Where is the Botany section? Botany is in the end. I could do this. 100%. I could do this! That's Physics row, right? Yeah, I can see that! In one minute you can? - You sure? - Oh! In one minute? Is she allowed to help me or not? No! No.. That was really quick! In one minute! Yeah, that's quick. Okay. Okay, so I got that wrong. 123. Okay.. Never mind. 147. Oh! never mind. You will still win 20 dollars! I will do it right after you are done! What's your name and what's your major? My name is Marwa and I am also a chem major and a math major as well. Awesome. And after your pre med what are your plans? Like you wanna do.. go for..? Med school hopefully. Oh nice. So you got all three? Awesome. Let's check the answer sheet. 2. That's right. 97... Number 2. That's right as well! Oh my God! Drum Roll! 3rd Question! 145.. It's 2. OHHH! - Sorry. - So close! You still won 20 dollars for participating. Don't worry. Is pre med hard or it's easy like.. how do you feel about pre med so far? We just started our classes. This is our first year.. So... So I am taking like Chem 1 and 2, Physics 1, Bio 1 So it's like all the basic linkage of classes. Nice. What are your plans after pre med? It's the same thing. Like.. probably go to med school and hopefully be a surgeon I am looking to either neuroscience or cardiology. I think most popular is internal medicine right? Yeah. I think it's mainly internal medicine because of the family and work balance. The work life balance. Nice talking to you. Thank you so much for your time! Would you like to introduce yourself first? Yeah! Okay. So I am Kaitlyn. And... and we currently go to Johns Hopkins University in Undergrad I am studying biophysics right now. Awesome! So what would you be pursuing after pre med? I don't know! That's a great question! Yeah, I am not really sure what I wanna do yet. Whether it's the actual going into medical school or... How about you? I am Isioma and I am also at Hopkins and I am studying medicine science and humanities I wanna be a PA surgeon but I don't.. - Nice! - yeah. And.. What about you? Hi! I am Soliana. I am also a student at Johns Hopkins I am studying molecular and cellular Biology And hopefully to be a pediatric oncologist! Pedria- sorry how do you? - Pediatric Oncologist. Kids.. Like a doctor who treats kids who have cancer. Pediatrician. Pediatrician? Okay. Perfect. So who wants to do first? Not me bro!! Okay. So basically this is NEET exam. This is our medical exam for high school students. So we take this exam to get into college as a medical student. I took humanities in High school. So let's see. Let's see. You take the exam to get.. - Where!! Where do you take this exam? In India. That's sick! It's one of the most challenging exams in India because you have to do 200 questions in 3 hours! That's a lot. That's so much. So do you get straight into medical school then? Yes! That's... This is gonna be so bad... If only!!! So basically it consists of Physics, Chemistry, Botany and Zoology. So what are your favourite subjects among these? What's my favourite? I like probably Physics and... Bro! I need to know how to do this!! 32. Is that 4? - That's right! 24. Is that one? Yes!! 123, I circled it. So I don't know where.. Oh no it's wrong!! NOOOO!! Oh, it sucks! By one question! Sorry... Oh my Gosh!! It's okay! You got two right! Who's next? Will you go? Or you want me to go? I'll go! Let's see. Let's see. Do you think med school is hard? (In the meantime) I feel like.. definitely. Just actually we were talking about that earlier. Pre med within itself is just hard enough for us. So I'll see. Well I am excited. I am excited to see what the future holds. 145... It's 2. Right. Okay. 1 right. I'm happy. We did it! That's all. 79.. 4.. Sorry. It's fine! It's fine.! 81? 3! Yes!! 2 correct! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yeah. You got 2 right! I can't hold the periodic table right? We can't see? No, we are not given in our NEET exam. You all are given periodic table but we are not. Let me solve this.. In order of least to greatest, Increasing. Yeah, okay. 32. So it's 2. Yes! Oh wow! You got this! Next number is 45 maybe? 45? - Oh yeah, 45 is 2! (EVERYONE CHEERS) You have done 2. 2 more, right? Okay. 166... 166... - So close. 1. You got it right!!! Congratulations. And last one. You did an extra fourth. Oh yeah. Let's just see. 28. 4. 28, 2... Sorry. Oh... that's fine. So what do you all think about the exam? Is it doable in three hours? In three hours how many questions? 180. Ohhh! No! 200 questions. That's difficult. And the only reason I feel like I was able to do do things was after almost a year of college. So... fresh outta high school?? I don't know.. That's diff- So kudos! Kudos to people that take that and pass that. So what's your name and what's your major? I am Valentina and I am a major in Neurosciences. Oh nice. So your plan is to do med after pre med, right? Yeah. So what's your plan after pre med, like Internal medicine or you have decided? I don't know... Not sure... Awesome! And where are you from? - Los Angeles. - Awesome. So you can go for it. You are pretty fast first of all. 62 is 3... Sorry. 92... 4. Yes! 45.. This is 2! Congratulations! Wait. Can I try? What is this for? It's a medical challenge. So this is our exam. So like.. if you have three options, you have three questions. you have to solve those three questions in 3 minutes. If you solve all of them you get 100 dollars. Are they multiple choice? Yes!! If I get 2 out of 3, do I get 70 dollars? No... That's crazy! That's crazy! She got 2 out of 3.. You get to pick your questions. - Oh really? - yeah. It's not that hard. Is this going out on YouTube? Alright. Ay, Instagram @tjbaii - Oh my God! So what's your favourite subject? Probably Mathematics. Maths is not an option. Math's not an option? That's crazy!! That's crazy! Cause he's a math major. Is there no math? You are not pre med? I am not pre med. Ohh! It's for pre med only! No-no-no! I am pre med. I am pre med. I am pre med!! Sorry.. What is the issue here? I am a computer science major. Oh! And what's your name? My name is Tjbaii. Add Instagram at Tjbaii! Okay! And.. Okay. It's awesome. Go ahead! And where are you from? I am from Michigan. Oh nice. That's quite close. So what do you feel about the exam? Amazing!! BOOM. Hundred percent! I am done! Okay. Let's check the answer sheet. Okay, wait-wait-wait! This one is right for sure, right? - Okay, you solved two? - I solved three. So 25 - 4. That's right. - BOOM!! - Yes!! BOOM! What else? - So I told you guys too. - 54. 54 - 1. I was so close! You were close! Yeah, all good. Estrogen. 57 is 2. That's right!

in the last few months something strange is happening in tech industry for international students I would say less than 15% nobody has to program and that the programming language it's human seniors senior software Engineers are in a demand if you follow tldr Bloomberg Wall Street Journal any Tech news you will only see news about AI you know maybe software engineering doesn't exist anymore what is happening what is wrong with tech industry right now in the US and all over the world let's talk about in this video so hi everyone I hard currently working as a software engineer at Microsoft and I have been so close to Silicon Val Engineers AI Engineers so four important things in this video update on the layoffs broken senior only Tech market update from the FDA and interest rate departments about the new hiring process and last what tech industry wants in 2024 number one layoffs so this is a story about h&v a couple in Bay Area who they were having a really good life both for making almost 200k plus salary having a great time and suddenly one of the employee of a big tech company not a small startup they get an email I was so scared that I was going to have like a panic attack an urgent email invite from a hiring manager yeah come immediately we need to talk about it the person is very nervous and that person is called to the hiring manager's cabin without giving time to pick up the computer no no time at all nothing but the person goes to hiring manager's desk he's given a notice K you are laid off and you should leave right now and exit the building no time given to pick up stuff from the desk he had the only photo of his mother on the desk and and suddenly kicked out of the desk also Google when they laid off employees the next day they open their laptop and they see that oh they don't have access to their computer no time given to take out the personal data from their computer and layoffs are so toxic sometimes that this is done so that when a person is going back to their desk they don't like you know use abusive language and they don't disturb the productivity of rest of the employees so that's why it is done as silently as possible which makes it really really toxic and when you leave that employer you feel like you know you have done a crime there's a bunch of research that finds that layoffs not surprisingly can lead to all kinds of bad things 20% decline in lifetime earnings increased risk of divorce cardiovascular disease depression even suicide you're no less than a criminal in tech industry when you're laid off but the harsh truth is this is part of American culture more than 40% of employees will get laid off at some point of time and this has been happening from the last 60 70 years as per the data now number two why layoffs are hard right now even in this third quarter so third quarter in the US has started since 1st July there were layoffs from Microsoft there were layoffs from many big tech companies the moment this quarter began so why layoffs are hot so much right now in 2024 is it AI is it something else so number one is non AI reason which was the movement done by Elon Musk so Elon Musk led the team of Twitter there were eight 1,000 employees in Twitter and laid off 70% of the workforce now there are only 2,000 people now if you look at Twitter app many people say it is better than before the application is light lightweight it is much faster than before and it works pretty seamlessly and it did not need seems like yeah 8,000 employees were not needed with 2,000 employees it is enough so as per Josh as well I watched his video he very well said that there is definitely area in tech industry when they hire more people they make their investors happy yeah we are hiring more people we are growing and we will make more Revenue we'll bring more Revenue as well so hiring more people is a sign that your company is doing well that's why companies Keep On hiring and the engineers sometimes for example at Snapchat they had a uiux engineering team of 400 people and Snapchat maybe doesn't need 400 people working on buttons UI they can just like Twitter they can maybe work productively with maybe 5 10 20 ux designers so there is definitely some hyper skills hyper category of Engineers which are not needed they are basic doing basic stuff they're just over hired even now that are being released slowly just to keep investors happy and just to show Wall Street that next quarter will be highly generating Revenue quarter so it's all about keeping the investors happy now next category of AI layoffs so it is true that AI has caused some sort of layoffs for example Shopify CEO there was a leak from Shopify CEO's message that the the biggest reason of layoffs has relationship with AI and I discussed with you know the AI expert from Silicon Valley from the professor Dr Ahmed banfa and he also agreed as well that AI will cause more layoffs but at the same time currently even now the more layoffs are customer engineering layoff for engineer layoffs but not experienced Engineers who are getting laid off who know gcp as well Azure as well aw as well no those are extremely rare happening in tech industry so let me give you an example uh currently when I was working at NCR so in NCR we use two Cloud platforms when I I was working there they use gcp as well they use you know AWS as well so if an engineer already knows those two cloud cloud platforms and they are already you know above a common engineer who knows these two Cloud platforms they're never going to get laid off but if there's an engineer who just knows AWS and is not able to you know go above and beyond responsibilities though W sh can be laid off so that's why I think there is definitely huge demand in Cloud I want to tell you AWS Amazon just you will be shocked this is the biggest AI news Amazon is going to use nuclear energy for their AI data centers directly from the nuclear plant this is this has never happened before Mark Z think before we hit that you're going to run into energy constraints said this in this in his podcast that biggest bottleneck biggest barrier to entry for AI is not the data it's not not the gpus it's not the hardware it is energy it is so true it is coming out to be true now that Amazon needs so much more energy for AI power data centers that they are going to pull out energy from nuclear power directly they're going to use nuclear energy and that shows how much demand after AI is in cloudbased learning you know these distributed system even the podcast I did with you know AI engineer in February we talked about that more demand is for software Engineers with distributed system knowledge and it is still so so true so that's why I am so glad to partner with code Cloud which allows you to you know use Amazon AWS gcp Plus Azure learn all those three together with one subscription and they don't like you know just give you tutorials they tell you go sign in to gcp experiment experiment with AKs clusters all the cloud services you need to know to be valuable for these AI companies to be an AI engineer so I love code cloud and you can go check out and get the specialty with my link in description below so how many people you think are actually getting job percentage wise uh percentage wise like it's below 10% now number three continuing with job market still International students are struggling to get a job I went to Stony Brook University I went to NYU more than 60% of international students haven't gotten a job yet it is so shocking more than 60% they will either do there another Masters either go back to India or maybe just do volunteering as a research assistant at the University or maybe do a PhD so they're trying all the options as possible so that they don't have to go back home and it is one of the worst time for international students someone can imagine now let me tell you the reason for that so recently Federal Trade Administration they released the news that let's say an engineer works for AWS Amazon you know they work for their Cloud platform now they want to go to their competitor like Amazon's competitor is Walmart or aw's competitor is Google Cloud platform now they want to go they can go easily that is not a problem anymore and these laws were you know uh earlier restricting employees to go to competitors now they can easily go unless you make above 150k or you are a senior engineer so if they are senior they cannot go if they are not senior they can go if they make less than 150k they can go if they make more than 150k they have those anti-competitive rules non-compete agreement there that prevents them to go to competitor so because of that this Market is more senior so let's say if a senior engineer comes to AWS they will be less like likely to go to gcp less likely go to Walmart less likely to go to competitors so this Market has become a senior only broken market now how to you know come out of this broken senior market how to be an engineer who can easily be hired so I you know with my 3 years plus of experience I apply I get a you know position easily because I am in that senior category but someone who is starting new in the US job market how can they break this barrier number one is they can ask their re research assistant for example when I was working in my University as a research assistant I asked my professor yeah can I just use the title senior senior research assistant they were like sure so just you know ask wherever you're working whether it's as a student if it's a teaching assistant you can just put Senior in it and ask the ask the employer can I put Senior in my title and you can cut that non senior market from your resume and be senior ready in in this you know senior is a is a buzz word in in the valley right now Whoever has like software engineer 2 or senior this these are just numbers if you can somehow put in your resume you break the site since you recruit a lot what are the most high paid jobs you see in the valley is it AI software engineer cyber security what are the ones you see well when we look at the websites with seller raes we can see that um senior seniors senior software Engineers are in a demand because for for example last week one of my friends got an offer for 800k wow where where was it this um it was uh Facebook so again data scientists machine learning Engineers AI specialist all seniors are always in demand so don't please don't be afraid of losing that job then AI cannot substitute those jobs number two is everyone is using AI generated rums these days everyone have the buzzword because yeah there are so many AI tools like teal Ai and all that I don't you know use that because at the end of the day up directly chat GPT use you can use directly chat GPT because at the end of the day all these AI tools are using some sort of llm like chat GPT and using some sort of prompt why use the third party and pay for it if Chad GPT Gemini and Claud are free give a prompt and just give the best prompt look for the best prompt and get all the buzz words for senior market this should be the prompt tell me if I am a senior versus now what will the buzz worth I have to add to my resume to be senior engineer use chat GP to be in your favor because these prompts no one knows they just ask the chat GPT yeah improve my resume no you have to improve your resume by comparing it with senior resume you need to know about it and chat GPT and all these llms are already trained with that data so these two strategies can help you come out of that senior only broken market and and number four is this job market is different currently genzies have chosen more white collar jobs as compared to older generation of Millennials because of that there is shortage in construction job market there is increase of $28,000 per year salary of any construction engineer or construction people that is so amazing because people are so hyped up about tech industry more people are choosing this major computer science and supply has increased so much and demand is kind of similar as before so that's why it is very important to stand out and for standing out I tell you number one the biggest advice I've given these days is don't just blindly email any hiring manager go to your browser look for all the conferences all the tech events where hiring was happening now the recruiters which were already hiring in those events they're still hiring now probably and email those recruiters who want to hire people as compared to just blindly emailing all the recruiters on LinkedIn no you need to find the right place right time so is you need to know which recruiters are hiring and apply only to those as compared to random recruiters and this can be only found if you just go and scrape the data of all the active events for example on Luma doai that's one of the favorite website I use on Luma you can see all the Bay Area events and see who are coming and this is this is like you know these are the recruiters or these were the people who were there to make awareness about the company and they definitely want Engineers so apply to those companies with these names of recruiters and the chance that be higher to hear back and last thing I you know I tell people you have to have something related to the hype currently Cloud engineering is at the biggest hype as you can imagine because Distribution Systems and this knowledge is highly demand because of AI AKs kubernetes and you know these uh these Services which deploy these llms on different different data centers and this can be okay and uh and U this distributed system just kubernetes you know distributed system like kubernetes Docker all of these skills connected with cloud computing can help you the most so you can go to Cod cloud and learn those Azure AWS as well as gcp on the same platform immediately so that'll be it go to cloudcloud don't forget to check out code cloud in description below and thank you so much for watching

not just happen faster but in the cloud with everything set up thanks to even Nims right Nvidia inference microservices every product that you use today has some form of generative AI so do you want to stick to just one AI app or just do you want to use generator a within all the existing apps so so there are two uh stages in any llm development pipeline one is in uh training and the second is inference there's a multiple step in order to like optimize a large language model to be production ready so hello everyone today we are in Nvidia office again we have Jay here who is expert in llms at Nvidia and we will be talking about what he thinks about the switch in the workforce especially For Engineers who are you know trained for years and years in data structures algorithms to prepare for big Tech there's an industry how we can evolve and prepare the engineers who are spending the full 100% from the age of 18 to 22 to give their best in their college and to learn the best Technologies and especially lot of coming in AI at Nvidia Nims lot to break down so hi Jay can you please introduce yourself sure hi herur hi everyone uh my name is Jay I am a developer Advocate uh at Envia focusing on large language model so my job is to educate developers on how they can accelerate uh llm workflows on Nvidia gpus so uh my background is in computer science so I did my undergrad uh from uh University of Pune in computer science and then came to the states uh for my masters in computer science with a focus in machine learning so I did couple of uh internships at startup and uh before uh coming to Nvidia I was doing a research internship at BMW uh doing computer vision and deep learning uh so where I got to use Nvidia software specifically it was called Deep Stream So basically accelerating video uh based uh version based computer version U on gpus and I also got to try out their Nvidia djx station so it's a uh workstation that includes four workstation level uh gpus uh So based on that I got to interview at Nvidia it went well and I started as a product marketing manager uh for deep learning software so I did that almost for three and a half years uh working uh and launching deep learning software uh so that was fun so I got to see the marketing side of software and I also got to work on Keynotes uh where our uh Jenson or CEO of Nvidia Jensen uh tries to showcase the latest and greatest at the Nvidia Flagship uh conference called GPU technology conference so uh but I wanted to be more Hands-On and more uh teaching oriented so that's why I took this role uh where I get to do some fun stuff and I really want to get to know you what what what are your goals here at Nvidia career-wise what do you think about what's happening what are you catching up to in llms gen correct correct yeah talking about uh goals I so I am a a passionate Tech Enthusiast I like Tech so I grew up watching all the Keynotes so uh working at Nvidia that was one of my goals about how how the keynote Cycle Works uh so I got to be part of it so that was fun but throughout the pro proc I was uh work working as a product marketing manager I was trying to see how can I communicate the new features uh to developers and part of which I was trying to come up with various strategies like will a blog or a video help with understanding this feature uh well to a developer I felt like I could be a educator as well and that's how I switched uh from product marketing manager to developer Advocate where I get to do all those stuff which is teaching uh through creating blogs uh creating technical videos and then going into conferences uh giving technical talks and teaching how a technology works and how I can help them uh and your blogs have reached like you know and have been cited in top research papers now yes yes yeah so that that has been my main motivation about educating uh developers and researchers on how they can um make their pipeline or research better by using Nvidia GP how did you figure out your passion for llms and how you got good at them correct so I think the passion for a deep learning started in my undergrad so back then there was a course called uh uh celf driving car Nano degree from Udacity and I was super passionate about deep learning because it was magic back then like understanding what's in the image that was great and taking it to a step further understanding how cell driving cars work and what are the algorithms behind it and it was mostly computer vision core computer vision and deep learning so that was my motivation and I enjoyed that uh aspect because it is also some form of art as well like figuring out like what should be the learning rate of the deep noodle Network and things like that so that was fun for me and that's how I got into deep learning uh and then llm as llm was evolving uh our team was also looking for someone who could educate developers about uh all the great stuff happening in the ecosystem and how how can they do it on gpus so I was like I'm up for it I I want to do it yeah how it has evolved what has fascinated you the most what are you catching up to now I think the earlier uh the notion was in the market that it it is based on my understanding and my opinions that U model were getting bigger and better better and that was the notion that bigger is always better but as the time has evolved I think people are also trying to go towards a smaller model because running big models like trillion parameter or like billion uh upwards of 500 billion parameter is not sustainable uh uh on a production scale right so you need lots of compute lots of electricity uh yeah a lot more money what are the three biggest things you have learned by being in Nvidia and in AI space first of all uh everyone here is aware about what uh what is going in the ecosystem like everyone is up to date and everyone you talk to knows about what are the latest model in the ecosystem how are they different from each other so everyone has a technical understanding about how these thing works uh the second learning I think everyone is humble here uh uh talking specifically about Nvidia everyone is super smart but they are also vulnerable or just try to give their best so it inspires you in a way that uh everyone is giving their uh like more than 100 person so it inspires and people are crazy smart here so it also helps uh talking about uh the AI industry I think it is evolving and specifically I like how uh everyone is trying to use generative AI as part of their daily life uh I I can give an example of mine so dayto day I use a lot of generative a I I don't think so I can uh go back to the earlier World pre uh llm or generator AI for example uh we have uh uh generative AI licenses Enterprise licenses so I try to brainstorm or just try to uh make progress on my scripts or just try to see how can I make this uh process better by just having a chat with an llm also uh in my daily life I use uh uh personal messaging apps and they also include now nowadays with integration with llm so I it just a tap away that is has been helpful for example if I need to go to a trip I just can ask hey give me a packing list also I I drive a Tesla which has a FSD so I can never go back uh driving manually or just uh focusing I just tried to use FSD it's so good so I think generative AI uh or AI in general has become a good chunk of my life and I think I can't imagine my life without it right and everyone focus in AI about the future I really want to talk about the present can you share what are the challenges you see right now and what problems you would like to solve being an AI being an engineer yes I I think uh specifically from the adoption of AI standpoint I think people are still trying to use how or still trying to understand how they can incorporate AI or llms as part of their daily workflow uh so there there are ton of tools for developers like co-pilots uh for improving their uh coding workflow or coding uh pipeline but I think people are still experimenting uh nobody has come to a conclusion that hey this is the best llm this is the best product uh to accelerate your uh coding uh so I think the same with I feel like companies are still trying to understand uh how they can use generative AI as part of their product and also empowering their Workforce so I think it is still work in progress I think maybe next year we might have better understanding about how this goes uh so so just my understanding or just my intuition so it's a very open field there's like you know no set path created for one problem correct you have to figure out you have to yeah it's a cat and mouse game right as people say yeah yeah I think every product that you use today has some form of generative AI so do you want to stick to just one uh AI app or just do you want to use generative AI within all the existing apps so but they don't share context with each other so that also might be a problem but I think yeah we are still figuring it out excellent so you have worked on the product side engineering side and you were in machine learning computer version from the beginning so can you share what is the difference between machine learning deep learning we used to do before the llm era versus now correct that's an interesting question I think uh uh the Deep learning era started with computer vision and that is where I think Nvidia GPU uh were explored or I think it was known that it works well with the AL Alex net uh introduction so I think before llm era there used to be lot more work around creating your application for example if you had to create a chart board there has there had to be much more work that uh needed to be done uh in order to fine tune uh the B model uh the B model from Google break it break it down yes yes so B so if you had to uh if you had to create a chart bot you had to uh first if if there's a response from a customer so you had to understand the text by breaking it down by removing all the stop words like the unnecessary Words which computer doesn't need to know like the uh in so you need to remove those then you need to understand the intent about what the intent about that phrase is so uh there was entity entity CL entity classification models that you were done and based on that you had you were coming up with a use case which was structured or which was just one of the five use cases in a customer uh Service chat bot so that is how the pipeline work but with the introduction of llm it just knows what so it understand the language so well that it can just directly answer like what is the use case that customer is looking for so you don't need to do all the pre-processing that was uh needed to be done in the pre llm or Transformers era and we have spreed up to a level that you know um those pre-training can now not just happen faster but in the class cloud with everything set up thanks to even Nims right Nvidia inference microservices that's the latest greatest that Nvidia released 2 years ago I watched the keynote big fan of Jensen hang how simplified simplified explanation he gave of nimes correct how would you explain names to the audience who are Engineers correct and who don't know anything about it yeah that's uh that's interesting and yeah I was part I went to the keynote uh saw it live it was amazing uh just that but uh so there's two ways so so there are two uh stages in any llm development pipeline one is in uh training and the second is inflence so training uh for training uh Nvidia has Nemo which we'll uh talk in depth later but focusing on the inference aspect inference is difficult or uh deployment is difficult and the reason being is so the all the models that you get uh for example uh model from llama 3.1 the latest model so they they have open weights available on hugging fees but you cannot just take those uh model weights and do start inferencing it is good for just a proof of concept or a demo but at the production scale it's not good because uh running that model would not get you the throw put that it requires for any production use case so all those models are in fp6 Precision so there are various Precision um uh uh available in deep learning so one of them is FP p16 which is floating 16 so which what does that mean is the number that are stored and computed are in floating 16 Precision so it is a 16 bit it would have like decimal level uh numbers which would be computed uh also during matrix multiplication and the problem with that is it is good for foundational model uh training or building but it is not good for inference because it requires much more compute uh at the inference side of things and to tackle that problem uh uh the usual method is to do quantization basically uh converting all the fp16 weights uh and activations to a smaller uh Precision in this case it could be integer 8 so it is integer only and 8 bit but you lose the decimal numbers uh in inate uh representation but there are various ways you can preserve uh those uh numbers or preserve the quality or the accuracy of the model by doing various kinds of techniques and uh but the upside is now you are not doing decimal computation so it is lot more easier and the numbers that are being uh computed or calculated in matrix multiplication it's just integer only so think of is like 7 8 9 so multiplying 7 into 8 is much easier than uh multiplying 7.12 3 into 8.6 3 4 so that's an example so uh that is one of the optimization that you can do to make the model run faster and then there's other optimization so you see there's a multiple step in order to like optimize a large language model to be production ready for inference for inference for inference right so uh Nim tries to uh make that process simpler by take making it easier or uh making it automatic for the developer so Nvidia uh the full form of name is NVIDIA inference microservices so you uh the idea is to uh you can basically get a microservice optimized container for any open source model that you can find on build. nvidia.com so there's almost I think there's two ways to access them so one is uh you can basically get uh or generate an API key like open AI and then basically use a open source model which is optimized and running on nvidia's cloud hosted infrastructure so uh for a for a free user I think you get th000 credits or th000 API calls for if you have an Enterprise account you uh or work email you get 500 uh 5,000 credits and but if you want to run that locally on your uh GPU so there's also a Docker container which you can uh basically follow the instruction on build. nvidia.com and just download it so once you download the docker container it starts executing it notices what is the uh Hardware that you are running so is it ampere based a100 is it Hopper based h100 and then it tries to download the optimized model for that specific hardware for your system and once it is downloaded the model is then uh hosted for inference and it gives gives you out a API endpoint which you can hit to uh get inference request or inference queries uh back so it is uh and it is easy to accommodate or just integrate that into your existing pipeline because it has a open AI API compatible server so if you are using open a API you can just try switching um uh with Nims and you should be good to go so let's say a company x correct they buys Nvidia Hardware h100 correct there is lot of training to use that Hardware which is $30,000 lot of training needed to you know use that hardware for any model for inference correct and to do it locally on that Hardware correct because you want to keep the data private correct now that has become easier with using the Nim microservice correct and now with that architecture you can do it on nida's website on the cloud and have it ready API ready model ready and you can use it privately there is that right yeah and it is all optimized and developer doesn't have to do anything so it brings the deployment time from weeks to uh several minutes in some cases or just days yeah excellent and what future you think it has changed for companies in terms of profits and in terms of employees needed to run a company correct that's a good question so in that case I think it helps uh employees spend less time on optimizing and just more time in iterating model and just deploying it so uh the reason being uh if you are just using the traditional way which is which is good if you so if you are if you have a really huge scale and any uh any inference time saved or through latency time save brings you millions of dollars then it makes sense to spend more amount of time in optimizing your model for your own use case but if you are just using open source models uh then you can just use this uh brings the deployment time uh significantly and yeah I think brings I think makes them more productive and uh being more iteration heavy than than just uh spending so much time on a single model optimizing overall for developers it is saving a lot of time because let's say at the end of the day LM llms are just like math multiplication let's say linear algebra multiplication or you know matrix multiplication earlier if there are two matrices like 3x3 Matrix 3x3 Matrix two multiplied in two functions a * B 8 * 7 and 6 * 5 correct both happening in a different function now you can happen both can happen in the same function in a simplified way like forgetting about the floating point if was 7.5 * 6.5 we can simplify it to 8.7 all the simplified process can happen in nvidia's inference microservice correct so it saves a lot of time in compute for for an engineer correct you mentioned Nemo framework as well which is so big part of nvidia's Foundry as Jensen hang says that you know data centers are The Foundry they are the system you provide bread and butter for these llms to work and function that's basically The Foundry is right that's how Jensen H explains it and Nemo is very big part of it explain what Nemo is and how it impacts developers okay yeah so Nemo is nvidia's open source generative AI framework where you can build develop and train uh fine tune uh Speech AI uh language based and vision based uh models so it covers everything uh in the training aspect so uh and Nvidia gpus are a first class citizen or this library is built for NVIDIA gpus so all the things that you do as part of llm development is uh GPU accelerated from end to end uh for example uh the there are multiple components of Nemo framework so first is Nemo itself which helps with training but then there's also Nemo data curator so if you're trying to build your own custom large language model or build a foundational model or just trying to uh generate a data set for fine tuning you can use Nemo data curator which helps you generate uh uh data set but and process all the information from uh like which is internet scale kind of data and it is completely GPU accelerated and it is powered by uh Rapids CF so Rapids is GPU accelerated uh uh site of libraries which includes uh GP acceleration for pandas pyit lar and all those P py toch so p is covered by codn but rapid is specifically for data science and data is mainly data science like how can you do data processing on tabular kind of data so that was Nemo data curator uh Nemo also contains Nemo guardrails which is important nowadays so guardrails is an open source library library which helps you add guardrails to your uh llm application for example it will uh make sure that your llm application doesn't go out of uh the boundaries or set of boundaries that you have created for your application or it is making sure the response is toxic or uh it is it's not toxic and U there within the guidelines that you have provided or not it also makes sure that the answers generated are within uh the context uh that the uh question is provided so that was Nemo Gils then there's Nemo customizer as well which helps you do the fine-tuning aspect so there are tons of good uh components and that you can use to build and train large language model and of course for inference there's uh Nvidia inference microservices on NY lot to unpack there so let's say an engineer a developer wants to you know use an existing model how n helps in simple words correct correct that's a good step by step yeah that's a good question Nemo checkpoints or the Nemo the models that are trained with Nemo have a different uh uh different specification so I think the model trains with trained with pyo comes with PT kind of uh checkpoints whereas uh model trains with uh trained with Nemo comes with Nemo so it has different kind of uh training mechanism so it tries to make sure uh that you are using all the uh GPU resources that are available at your disposal uh including various kind of parallelism so if you have multiple gpus so how can you paralyze the training mechanism on multiple gpus so uh you don't have to work through whereas with other Frameworks uh GPU is supported but you need lot more expertise in order to paralyze that workload throughout the uh data center or the multiple gpus that you have and you provide this on Nims as well as so n is mainly for inference uh inference workload whereas Nemo is mainly focused for training and fine-tuning large language model okay so uh like starting from data processing to build uh for uh foundational large language models to fine tuning or customizing your model for your specific use case which could be Enterprise based or your customer related yeah excellent so Nemo accelerates the development of new models correct and Nims ACC Ates how you process data and inference quickly as quickly as possible correct yeah so think of training is um you can accelerate training with Nemo and inference with nyss excellent and I really want to ask you about fine tuning you mentioned that fine tuning is accelerated with Nemo right so basically what happens in fine-tuning is uh you provide a set of uh responses so question and answer you create that data set and try to uh create a layer on top of existing open source model and try to like uh influence the weight in such a weight and activation layer in such a way that it learns like what are the question and answers and what is the correlation between them so it tries to understand uh with the data set that you have provided uh with qu question and answers it learns that and it can can answer the question directly um whereas with I think the other option is using rag so but with rag they uh the llm has to like understand uh what the uh what the whole context or the whole document is about and then come up with answer I see what do you see in 20year Old Engineers who want to be part of your team in AI what skills you would like to see in them I think uh uh llms or generative a a has become so good nowadays that you can solve any problem uh by just uh chatting uh with that AI so uh which means that you lose the motivation to understand what is happening uh like how does the neural network work uh what are uh how does learning rate impact the model training process so things like that I feel like uh people or students should spend more time understanding what goes behind the scenes or what are the foundations of large language models and there are tons of courses out available out there from Nvidia from other uh uh other platforms like deep learning. so I uh I recommend taking those course in and really understanding like what's the math behind it because I've seen some people don't like the math and just uh shut off uh learning AI or deep learning and then go to uh software engineering so uh but I think that is uh that is helpful to understand how uh models works that uh that is impacts your model usage or how you uh fine-tune the model or how you uh uh engineer The Prompt in such a way that you get your desired results if if you don't have that understanding then uh it makes uh makes it hard at the latest stage when you're doing the job and then you might need to like just go back and learn that again so I would focus like uh understanding the basic and or the foundation before just jumping on it what technical skills you would want in them in the Engineers okay okay so that's a good question I think awareness of all the tools uh open-source tools available out there like uh pie torch hugging face like you should know how to use them and uh if you want to train a model like what tool would you use uh if you want to fine tune a model what are the uh techniques to fine tune and what are the uh uh Frameworks or libraries are out there uh to use uh to do the fine-tuning process can you can you name some yeah so far fine tuning you can use uh hugging face uh it has a tool uh called Laura I think there's a function called Laura uh for uh Nvidia also has a Nemo customizer within Nemo faor uh so then that was that and then for training you can use py I I think you can use hugging face as well uh Nemo of course so I think there are tons of tool I think first having awareness and then maybe pick one uh out of of all the available tools and then trying it out on your own data set or just trying uh try building a demo project in order to like learn all this stuff what projects you would like to see in the resumés that you will hire for AI teams okay okay that's an interesting question so I I don't like generic projects like chat llm chat Bots or rag I feel like uh those are easy to reproduce or recreate like anyone can do it after taking a course I feel like uh people or students should try to look a problem in their daily life uh that they have been facing and try to build a solution using llms and then maybe uh just come up with a project which can live on GitHub uh so what would you build if you were in their place 22 year old I feel I I would like to create a Chad bot like her which has uh her the movie Her the most popular yeah yeah yeah not the romance aspect but just uh managing the daily life like uh today's my appointment with my uh physician or an appointment with my AO uh optometrist so things like that uh uh uh the AI should be able to like remind me that hey I need to I have a flight tomorrow so please check in currently I think those tools are there but uh these are disintegrated having a one single tune or one llm which has the context of your calendar or maybe what are the upcoming appointment trips and things like that so that might be a fun uh project yeah that I would work on excellent explanation of what student should make I think her project is definitely doable in today's world with the resources now how you got good at llms and how you became llm expert at Nvidia correct so uh I already had a deep learning background through my uh undergrad in Pune yeah Pune yes so uh not specific Ally from the uh University but I was doing courses on the side and also coming to the states I did uh my masters uh in CS but it was focused on ML and I got to do bunch of internship throughout my time so it was all deep learning so I had my deep learning uh Basics covered uh but for llms I think it wasn't that hard going from uh deep learning to llm side of thing because uh I already had the understanding of Transformers U mainly coming from BT models but it was just a uh little different in the llm space so I took a bunch of courses available out there uh like uh student word from corsera uh and other uh learning platforms so that was my introduction and I as I was ramping up I I did some projects uh tried to understand how the all the tools work in the ecosystem and just tried uh running uh those on gpus so I did nothing basically took the examples that are that were given the courses or in the GitHub repositories from the tool makers or Library providers uh and just uh run them and try trying them on gpus and yeah what what's your most impactful work in llm uh that defines you as an expert okay okay that's an interesting question okay so uh I recently I worked on a multimodel AI rag uh project uh so uh the video is live on Nvidia developer YouTube channel so if someone wants to go in and see how it works so feel free to but yeah so it basically creates a uh multimodel AI rag pipeline or rag agent which can answer question uh based on your PDF PowerPoint presentation which can include charts plots uh images so so it extends uh rag with multimodal capabilities ingesting all uh various kinds of PDFs PP uh PPT popo presentation so excellent I think rag based pipelines had been very limited you know it was just Tech space and multimodality is excellent and what else if you'd like to name uh yeah so I am working on few more projects which I can't name but uh yeah stay tuned what what future you see with LMS and rag based systems right now so I feel like uh rag uh rag will evolve uh with of course the new direction is multimodal uh capability I think there's ton of research going on there uh the other thing with rag I feel like uh this model the smaller models will be much more useful so as the models are getting smaller it is easy and efficient to run rag pipelines so if model is good at reasoning I think that should be good enough to uh connect with the external data source or database and get the pipeline running than uh having a model which is Big which is which has the World Knowledge but uh in a Enterprise setting for this particular use case that World Knowledge isn't relevant right so just using a smaller model which has good uh reasoning capabilities connecting uh that to a large uh database or Source uh Source data uh of Enterprise I think that would be a good use case uh the other thing that I see is uh I think local co-pilots as uh as the model are getting smaller uh there's ton of optimization that uh can be done and if is being done which is making uh making them run on small devices like laptops and phones nowadays so I think that is a good Next Step that we are heading into so that we don't have to send our data to a server you can just run the models locally on uh a smartphone or laptop and get the results what are the challenges you see in your day-to-day life in llms and what misconceptions people have of you around you correct uh so uh talking about challenge is I feel like this uh the the field is moving so fast that it's sometimes hard to keep up what's happening and just uh trying to understand like I think there was a time uh in one or two weeks there was announcement of three or four open source models and then there was also uh Tech bunch of research or techniques that were was uh announced or released by few companies that how to make uh the context length bigger and better for model so I think in that case it's really hard to uh uh hard to understand like what thing should I focus on or also uh I'm also thinking about how can I educate about one technology to our developers right so picking one technology out of the spectrum uh becomes hard and also keeping up with it is also hard but I think I have my uh setup uh which has been helping me uh so I just try to follow a bunch of folks on Twitter and just try to see what they have posted or what uh what's new and what's better so that's uh one thing or one challenge I think uh also uh uh I I'm producing videos now so uh generating or producing videos uh is a new skill for me so that is new uh but your sessions I've have seen some of your sessions on YouTube yeah you you you teach pretty well about LMS and especially that rag project I think our our CEO says that uh you shouldn't be afraid afraid of AI I think you should embrace AI uh which means that you you should be able to or you should try to learn all these generative AI tools uh uh which improves the productivity of a developer or anyone using it so that they become super human and be Irreplaceable so that's a thing uh that uh I follow I think just Embrace this try to see how can I improve my workflow uh by using all these tools uh and get more productive rather than just avoiding it and being scared out of it the biggest misconception of any AI engineer is the fear they bring in the life of Engineers but but I think you know Jensen W says the in the best way that Engineers will no longer be Engineers they will become super humans or super Engineers right one thing I've seen in llms that is lacking is that let's say I want to customize for my own use case let's say I have an English paper I wrote you know for my students and 50 students submitted it correct every different model like of competitors like meta Google anthropic they all can give different points some give 9 out of 10 10 out of 10 11 out of 10 but if I want a system in AI I want to give let's say based on grammar I want to find fine tune it and put a criteria if grammar is excellent give 10 out of 10 and if let's say ke if if let's say the wording is not American English and British English deduct points I want to make my own metrics correct I cannot do that properly right now correct so what what you think the future is in this process driven development is that in the talks right now so I think there's three ways to approach this problem so the first or uh the easiest one is uh using prompt engineering so uh what does this mean is you uh create a prompt in such a way so descriptive that the model knows how to grade uh these uh uh questions or Answers by giving them uh by giving it a few examples about how would you do it so uh if this is the answer I would rate this as six is this is the answer so you create a basically a prompt before uh asking llm to judge or uh query or just uh submit a uh assessment for a question so that's the easiest way but the problem with this is it is not uh consistent yes that's the problem yeah and the second one is you are increasing the context length of the model so if you're running this at scale this might become a problem so the second one is you fine-tune the model uh using one of uh the techniques which is uh for example Laura so which is very efficient in terms of fine tuning so you basically create a data set about uh responses and grade so you create that data set and try to re uh try to train a model with those data set and get uh it will give you a fine tune model which you can use uh to assess and the third or the most uh uh I think expensive ways to create a foundational model from scratch just for this purpose so I think based on this I think the finetuning aspect uh just creating a data set about how would you rate uh answers I think that would be a better option and the tools are available out there like hugging face and it is also GPU accelerated so you can use openly or freely available gpus like T4 uh with I think that would support only a certain size of model uh but I think that will still will get you started right and a lot of Engineers watching me you know they think that llms are expensive NLP ways you know before llms are still cheaper than using an using like you know apis of these large langu models because for large scales they become still very expensive mhm so do you know some hacks or ways to reduce the cost per token or like to use a prompt that uses less tokens mhm mhm in LMS okay okay okay I think I feel like uh this is a prompt engineering question and it is more art uh than science but what I've seen is uh being descriptive helps and there are tons of courses out out there available on how you can uh create a a specific prompt that will get you I don't have any like specific answers but I think just try to take one of those courses uh but what I've seen is being descriptive really helps yeah what security risk and threats you see while building an llm using an llm inferencing an llm in all three stages I think uh mainly the security risk is at the deployment side uh I think one of the examples is prompt injection where you just basically ask a a customer chart board to do a non-customer service or use case and that uh in some cases it answers that question so I think it is much more uh recommended to have guard rails around your uh use case or uh deployment uh for which Nvidia has Nemo guard rails which helps you do that but there's are other open source tools available as well how does it work how do guard work so you basically uh try to see and judge all the queries that or the transaction happen between user and the llm and uh the Nemo guardrail tries to check if the response generated is within within the boundaries like it is not toxic and it or it is not going uh outside of the use case so there's multip like there's ton of documentation but it just makes sure that uh the llm response are generated without within a guard rail or within a boundary that the application is supposed to do and not go outside of Hardware G right no so these are not Hardware these are software uh so you basically H write a a specification about uh what what your needs are so there are various parameters uh so there's documentation available so security threats are more on the Infant side M so that we need to we need some guard rails so that we can protect the answer of that prompt comes related to what you asked and software level guard rails are Nemo is part of Nemo guard rails Nemo guard rails yeah now any other threats you see that we need to be cautious about for all the startup Founders watching this or AI Engineers watching this yeah I think just I think the Gil would be the most important uh thing for now all so uh I think there's there are various tools out there in terms of generative AI so I think we should be uh we should make sure that what kind of data is being sent uh to the clouds while processing if they are uh keeping their if they are keeping our data onto their servers or not so things like that should be uh more uh we should be more careful of using those tools awesome and I heard that there is NVIDIA conference coming up in India can you please share details on that yes yes yes yeah so uh there's a uh conference called Nvidia AI Summit uh that is upcoming in India uh it would be in Mumbai at the Geo uh World convention center and Jensen will be there uh having a fireside chat so and there will be ton of good sessions as well uh uh ranging from data processing uh to llms and everything in between so uh I would recommend your audience to join that and uh uh your audience will also get a 20% discount on the conference price uh so that I'll share it and you can put that into the YouTube description awesome thank you so much Jay it was wonderful talking to you learned a lot as always and I hope this video inspires more Engineers AI enthusiasts to devel to do development the right way thank you so much again using Nemo and Nims thank you again thank you for having me

--- Content from ./data/youtube/Tech_Industry_will_Change_Forever!_Trump_on_Future_of_Tech_Jobs_&_H1B_🇺🇸!.txt ---

tech industry is going to be forever changed from now since Donald Trump has been elected and this video is going to be the brutal truth you should hear because many people will predict the positive side many people will predict the negative side but all those predictions will fail because as someone who has been in college when Trump was the president as someone who was working in Tech when Trump was the president and then switched to Biden's Administration I have seen the unpredictive nature of trump and I'm going to give you all the facts and to tell you what you should hope in your future as a student coming to the US or in terms of future as a tech person in the US I think that anyone who gives you a definitive answer on what they think the future is is like full of it because like there's no predicting with Donald Trump like it all depends on who Lobby him it all depends on who he's fighting with it all depends on who's kissing his ass like it all just depends on so many things if there was one thing that was predictable during the first four years of trump it was that nothing is predictable wow number one do not try to predict anything like I want to tell you when Trump was the president he did tariffs on China but those tariffs were not applicable for all companies Apple was was Exempted for tariffs on iPhone Apple watch and Mac products why because they LED whatever Trump says that's the unpredictable nature of Donald Trump that anything can happen at any point of time based on who is lobbying Donald Trump and at what price and what suggestions they give lobing is in the form of money which is also considered kind of legal corruption in the US or it could be just sort of formal advice that is given to the president or the cabinet of the current incumbent president before sharing the next brutal truth I want to tell you next four years it's going to be clickbait news which is going to scare the out of you whether it's Times of India or any Indian news or American News because that's how they make more money and a simple example could be they will highlight that Donald Trump has win the house the Senate and president and Supreme Court too but the truth is also in 2016 as well Donald Trump had won the presidency Senate and House as well so he had the trifecta in 2016 too it might be more powerful in 2024 but don't think that people in House and Senate are stupid that they will just you know do anything they want to so that's why do not stop your decision to study in the US if you are and our consultancy fly with sing is there to help you you will find all the free resources on fly withing whether it's letters of recommendation or you want to get helped to shortless universities you will get the support you need and I can proudly say fly with sing is arcc credited only few consultancies in India are arcc credited and I can proudly say it is partnered with admit card so go check out go to fly with Singh and get started with your study abroad Journey now next brutal truth Elon Musk and Donald Trump partnership is not as easy as it sounds like so Elon Musk has 8% 6 to 8% share of Eves sold in China and he he definitely wants to increase it because if China which is close to implementing full self-driving of Tesla in China he will get lot of sales his market value of Tesla will increase and Tesla has reached trillion dollar market cap after Donald Trump became president so he really wants to get more out of China and increase his business worldwide at the same time Donald Trump wants to put tariffs in China and in 2019 Donald Trump and China's prime minister XI jingping came to a deal both sides trade wars were happening so in this trade Wars that may start again who is going to win is is it Elon Musk who will maybe reduce the number of tariffs and Chase the win or is it going to be maybe Donald Trump who is going to put tariffs no matter what it is completely unpredictable so that's why you should not even try to predict what's going to happen at the end of the day American corporations are going to win no matter what happens some will win those who are able to Lobby the most just like apple lobbied for exemption from tariffs that were imposed for China imported goods So based on whoever Lobby is the best they will win and in the end there will be more job growth in the US regardless number three the opportunities in AI will increase because the AI executive order that Biden put in 2023 October that basically says that you need to have standards for AI and if something bad happens due to AI such such as the movies you have seen for example upgrade is a very good movie in which AI does really bad uh other is Space Odyssey which is a movie which a lot of American students and American AI enthusiasts have seen which AI does really bad and takes control over human being so basically Biden's AI executive order is if AI does something really bad the companies should be responsible and they should actually share the training information to the government and Republicans all the other side say that that can actually lead to trade secrets if training data is shared then trade secrets are basically shared so they want to cancel this executive order and AI Innovation can actually actually accelerate after Trump administration because of the deregulation and this will create probably more opportunities for everyone to grab an AI more competition more opportunities and ease of business Number Four rise in cyber security Donald Trump wants to really go tough against China because earlier China found the hack of using some of the US servers like on like on some Cloud platforms now he really wants to fight even tougher on those and increase in cyber security efficiency of the system you know with cyber security being wable there is a potential of $10 trillion to be lost in cyber security hacks but 99% of these hacks can be avoided by simple cyber security principles simple clean habits and he wants to encourage these habits to even more companies so that we are able to fight this cyber security War on a stronger end and there will be more opportunities and cyber security coming up for sure number four the web 3 era is coming back crypto currencies the cost of bitcoin ethereum you saw the spike in the price after Trump won now what's going to happen is if I share the details in the US Bitcoin and ethereum are considered Commodities and rest are considered Securities and securities go through lot of regulations because lot of scams can happen for example example FTX was was a scam that happened and many many people worldwide suffered because of FTX not giving your cryptocurrencies back from your wallet so because of that there were a lot of regulations but now Donald Trump wants to you know make us cryptocurrency Market the biggest in the world and because of that there'll be definitely more opportunities coming in web 3 development apps development the use cases of these currencies and some decentralizing of social media and more apps can hopefully come because the regulations will be far less this time and this is also very unpredictable because the cost of cryptocurrency should be equated to how much use case is there and currently use case hasn't increased as much in the last four years if the use case increases then there will be more demand as well and that is still very unpredictable and last the future of stem op and h48 when Donald Trump was the president this was very very unpredictable to tell whether stem op will be canceled or not because he did try to cancel stem op just because it was not passed around the 60% majority in House and Senate it did not go through even if he wanted to but now since he has majority in both and if all the Democrats in House and Senate vote for that bill then only it can be passed of course he has more power now but still there are checks and balances and because Elon musk's company Tesla has so many H1B workers I think he will definitely be actually lobbing maybe possibly against that bill as well so it's still very unpredictable questionable I cannot answer these questions so that's why the biggest advice I ask you to do is just do not predict and play bye the biggest hope you can have right now is us is the land of opportunities and will possibly be the land of opportunities if immigrants stay currently the biggest Google search was by US citizens mainly especially by women who want to immigrate to New Zealand Australia Canada and this spiked by 3,000% When Donald Trump got elected but immigrants who have a job and they trying to leave after Donald Trump they don't try as much until unless they know that they are actually getting kicked out so don't worry too much don't predict the future that much think about the bubble you can actually impact and things that are actually in your control if you always think about things that are not in your control you will not be able to actually be productive and you will not be able to do the things that you actually can so that'll be my advice so that's pretty much it thank you so much for watching and I'll see you guys in the next one goodbye

they said they get 80,000 emails in a week from India I took like uh seven attempts in starting a company and this was like one of the last ideas left in my PL statement bucket and I ended up launching it got good feedback and then since then the journey has been great uh then you got accepted right no no still then also we didn't get accepted really yeah this was a sixth rejection with Rag and AI based projects second time with AI you got rejected yeah yeah so even after failing seven times what kept you going no matter whatever you're doing you always stick to basic and Basics that's what do so this is startup HQ where tan startup is incubated so hello everyone today I have the honor to interview taranjit CEO and co-founder of mzero if I have to show you with an example how it impacts me in my apartment we have k sujan and me we split our rent and some amount is fixed some is repeating and some is variable so I have put it into m zero and every first of month if I say split my rent extra dollars of 90 let's say a $90 extra rent it automatically remembers rent of Ky sujan and mine and automatically divides it has a memory layer if you want to ask your manager today I want to take off it will remember that that you are going on a vacation one month later and will write that custom email so it is very useful for me and now let's get to know the Journey of thin what it took to build the startup today we have th here he had an incredible journey of getting into YC he applied seven times coming to Bay Area we are currently in startup HQ which is incubators for startups like you know for inspired startups like of and start now we have like you know these these buildings which are on lease and rented for the startups so that they can start their Journey so hi tan can you please introduce yourself hey uh like thank you for having me here I think really excited to be here I keep watching some of your videos and like it's like like fun to be doing one so thank you for this opportunity uh I think my journey started uh in India I did my undergrad in computer science I did work at PTM when it was was not a well-known brand I I did like a lot of uh I took like multiple attempts in starting my own company and it's been a journey of uh learnings and like failures and like reflecting what went wrong and then improving it into the next uh iteration currently I happen to run a company a scof out and Co the company name is mzero uh we are a open- source uh company we have like 22,000 GitHub Stars we are loved by our developers very much we are building like a long-term memory for large language models uh it's one of the most important problems in this uh AI geni era to solve and 22k get up sols 22 amazing yeah I mean like thank you all our like supporters for all the love I think without you we wouldn't be here excellent and first of all like I really want to admire how you you know made it finally you started with you know SAS explain how you started pitching to YC and how you pivoted to make it finally the seventh time in AI I think uh so I applied to YC for the first time in uh 2020 from India online yeah from India online so T say I've been just trying to apply uh the first time when we applied uh I was trying to build a alternate Android App Store uh we got Ed for an interview but were rejected uh but then we kept pursuing it and then it was a series of multiple uh I think pivots on the idea and even on the like team also like I was working with someone else before but uh uh went through like a journey of reflection also where in like initially the problem that I was trying to solve uh it felt like a problem but at a small scale then what happened that I left my job in October 201 22 right before this gen wave was about to start and I applied to YC I think it was like fourth or fifth time with idea which was like a GPT store which is what we have right now back then uh so gpt3 era at the time yeah so this is like I I I remember dates very well so August end May stability was launched and at that time I started like the resignation process like right I mean around that time only and 30th November 2022 uh I the GPT 3 is launched and then first December I think CH GPT was launched that's the time say and 6th December Co I launched this product which was like a GPD store and I applied to YC it was a late application but uh I think we didn't get selected I was solo also at that point of time and then I applied uh I got like good I think I didn't get like uh I mean to be clear like very the feedback that was missing but uh the product was uh getting feedback from the user so I kept improving I then applied again uh to YC but got uh rejected and then with same idea or different yeah it was like a yeah so what happened applied with GPT store only uh but there was like some modifications that I made and I think the common feedback that I got was like you know it will be better if you get a co-founder and then uh what happened that I focused Less on applying to Y and I focused more on solving or figuring out a problem uh at that point of time this GPT store led me to a problem which was like a developer tool problem where I realized that developers are struggling in creating AI applications so I built this product called embed chain and uh I have a longtime friend called DH Raj who is my co-founder in CTO right now we both met in undergrad College in 2012 which college uh so we went to a college in NOA it's called jss NOA uhh and both of us like did a lot of projects together in college uh and we also built a very popular open source alternative to kagle together so then we decided uh like back then this was happening I was launching I was like going through like multiple iterations on this developer tool product uh I ended up one I ended up at one form which was like embed chain launched it on GitHub it went viral uh I mean like got like I think 600 starts in 2 three days wow embed chain can you elaborate what is it so basically uh the language models they have like a training cut off date and they do not have context of your own data so let's say if you ask them you know how many emails in my Gmail inbox are talking about fixed deposits or credit card they don't know because they don't have the context of your Gmail inbox so there is this technique called RG which is retrieval augmentation rack so we built like a very simple I think the simple framework in the world to do RG back then oh and with with with Vector database or without uh with Vector database so we made it very easy for even like my brother who is like very beginner programmer to get started and build like a AI app back then this is like uh June 2023 when like the AI field is still L people are figuring out like what to do and it's difficult for them to get uh hold of these technical Concepts and we built this uh I I built it launched it and then like we ended up uh we got like good traction I think I wasn't expecting that I think I was like thinking to take like a in break because I've done like so many I think I was at a hacker house in Bangalore during this time at my at one of my very close friends he runs a company was staying with him for like 3 months I went there for like 7even days ended up staying for 3 months and this was like one of the last ideas left in my uh I think Plum statement bucket and I ended up launching it got good feedback and then since then the journey has been great uh then you got accepted right no no still then also we didn't get accept really yeah yeah yeah so the journey is so what happened that I uh we launched this uh I I still was like alone solo on this idea I launched it wrote like 200 emails to people in the valley uh about like you know raising like raising a round with them two of them responded uh uh one of them ended up investing and like helped me with my uh I mean help me in my further Journeys and the other person also helped and I came to I mean Valley like literally in just two days it was like uh I mean I'm just talking to them and like in 2 days I ended up being here uh my parents were very surprised with what and then desraj uh ended up joining as co-founder and CTO and then we applied to YC but we got an interview and we were not selected so this was a sixth rejection yeah this was a sixth rejection with Rag and AI based projects second time with AI you got rejected yeah yeah and then what happened that uh I think uh uh the feedback that we got was good very like the feedback was you know you need to figure out more about what kind of use cases this rack framework will enable so we took that feedback uh in a positive way and went deep we started doing a lot of improvements on the product and now this is like December uh 2023 January 2024 which is this year like starting we ended up realizing like a very fundament problem uh which uh is what MZ is about uh we changed the name from embed chain to mzero we did like a lot of product improvements and well and then this time uh we applied to YC like YC opens up their early applications so we applied to YC this time and uh this is like March uh 2024 and this time we are already in like you know uh I mean I think we were like uh we just applied with the application we got an interview and this time we got selected wow and you know this this year we have three batches of YC's coming and usually though usually two batches but three batches because the craze for AI is insane yeah just like how inspiring is the Journey of th it is also off the app called Mumu which started from Palo Alto California as well and has reached almost 23 million users and I use it every single time I look at the market trends or if I have to look at China and Hong Kong's Market because there are rarely stock brokerages apps in America like muu which allow you to which allow you to invest in Hong Kong's or China's stock market and look at the level two data with that much information and just like 62% of Americans in the US who have a stock brokerage account you can be one of them it's completely legal on F1 H1B visa and get started immediately by going to start. momo.com sing inusa and get up to 15 free stocks and 88.1% apy go start right away what an incredible journey so I really want to ask you in this process uh what is the difference between fifth sixth and seventh in your product m zero embedded chain so feedback Implement so it was first a rag pip I want to integrate in my email and it will be a chat bot now what is extra now than before I think so fifth time pay uh there was this product called cook up. which is the GPT store that I mentioned it was a application limit product what does it do uh if you know the GPT store right now you can go and create your custom gpts so it was like a natural language based interface where you can type in give me like a uh restaurant give me like a app which takes in the name of dish or name of ingredients that I have and give me like a proper recipe so it started like that uh that was like application Level product was P I figured that the it was too early and we figured that maybe the users that we getting uh are not uh uh finding this product much valuable the sixth product which was embed chain RG framework the feedback that we got from YC was uh uh maybe you need to figure out like two three big use cases where you feel like this is super valuable because when you're building like a framework Frameworks are hard to monetize so you need to figure out like what is something that will monetize on top of framework and what is something like a general purpose framework would do well that was the feedback that we got from YC and we when we were working on this feedback we got feedback from our users about this memory problem so what happened that this year starting and last year December we started noticing that a lot of our users are doing frequent interactions with AI models and they have to just tell them everything again and again so let's say if I doing like you know one interaction with chat GPT right now I will that my name is sanjit Singh I based here I grew up in India I do XYZ I love ABC so these sort of things I have to tell CH GPD again and again what happened in February CH GPD ended up launching a early feature of their memory which is what they try to solve it for but uh the idea is that these models they are stateless they they are sort of dumb in a way where they don't know or they don't remember things about you so we figured that this is happening because in their architecture they don't have this you know concept of memory big de like like I've met you next time let's say if I'm meeting you again I'll remember that you were wearing like a black color T-shirt I met you at the uh SF I Met You in SF right so I will maybe crack like some joke about SF or maybe like say something which is like related to this meeting right that's something that llms can't do by themselves so then we started focusing on this problem statement specifically and uh this problem statement is like an emerging problem statement right now I think only open CH GPD no other llms right now have memory built in with them so so only open ey and uhgb and also like I think Google has memory right no so gole no jini doesn't have any memory perplexity has it perplexity also doesn't have memory uh what they do is I mean if you just chat in the same thread the context is pass but let's say if you go back and be like who am I sort of question it won't remember oh maybe you they might build like a profile where you can add in details so that's all they remember but right now that's not there so they have chat history but not memory but not memory yeah open ey has memory it remembers who you are so memory is important for example H like for example I put in like for examp and there is extra amount this divide I have to put in the fam formula every single time open air doesn't remember CH doesn't remember I have to put it again have to tell it every single time and that is feature I really want frustrating yeah yeah so so we are building like a so we are building like a developer tool but what we are doing is since this is a problem that all the users who are using like LMS will have so we are building like a playground sort of feature then you also can come and use it we built like a very good Chrome extension for cloud uh uh my co-founder launch launched it last week and that's like a button with says m zero it comes next to the send button in Chrome extension in the cloud and you can use it to add had any memory or send it out there excellent and since you have done R to does it have a feature for example problem when I'm talking to chat gbt there are so many history topics do you have the ability with rag to add Hao topics thousand topics of History can be you know Consolidated into five or six that I can click using rag is that also top of your mind so that's not a problem that can be solved using rag uh that's a problem that involves summarization so maybe you have like you know 100 subjects or 100 topics out there you're trying to condense it into like you know 10 things out there and on that also chats so thousand chats of History yeah Consolidated into five Oh you mean the chat history oh yeah that's what memory will do it so that's something that you can do using rag but what will happen that rag is not the best way to do it so I mean there are like technical limitations when you're doing rag memory may what happens that we building like this technology which understands okay this is a kind of information that should be stored in this way and this should be retrieved in this way whenever this things comes up so you can give your thousands of charts out there we'll make sense of it and we'll give you like you know a profile so you'll see your profile your all attributes maybe based in ABC uh does this works at this runs this these kinds of thing and that's how your profile gets created Incredible Journey so seventh time when you got accepted the biggest difference is you are solving a biggest problem in M that memory is lacking and we discussed problem both problems are one is solved and second you are in the process of solving right yes you told me that the biggest challenge for anyone to make a company and apply to VY in India is that product you can make the product but it's really difficult to do anything after that finding co-founder finding that and I was at an event of Southwest Commons the biggest one of the biggest wec here they said they get 80,000 emails in in a week from India no everywhere all over the world oh my God 80,000 emails and you sent emails too and it stood out so can you share product to this how how you made it what it takes I think uh India I mean uh uh I think India also is a land of opportunities and the startup system has matured a lot uh some of my uh I mean I've been early at PTM I've been early at katab book so I've seen a lot of people around me starting their own companies but I think like if you're trying to build like a technology company which is like you know pure technology company it will still work well in India but the point is that in Bay Area I mean you might uh find it uh you know more favorable because people take bet on new technologies people take bet on something which sounds weird may not make money right now but may end up making money in the future so I think uh that's one thing that I feel uh is there and I I feel like uh India also you can like you know do startups uh what did what something that I learned and improved in my journey was ke rather than just building like a cool product if I can figure out actually what is the you know user problem that's there why is it important uh for the user that that problem should be solved like there are many many problems that I have right I can say like you know I'm my shoes are not good but that's the problem that is not important for me to solve right now right so then that if that problem is important for the user to be solved and then if I feel like you are one of the best persons to solve that problem so that's what the founder market fit thing is right so I feel like if you try to figure out let's say I can't go and like run a uh maybe like a delivery business right I I I don't know much I can figure it out but I don't know much about it right so I feel like if you focus on truly understanding what is a problem once you start doing that everything else generally happens in place I also used to feel like startup is some you know magic recipe which I don't have it but I took like uh seven attempts in starting a company not the YC application I've been doing I've been trying to do uh I think my own startup since 2012 and each uh attempt that I took uh taught me you know that if you understand there is like a particular type of user their problem why that problem is very important for them to solve and then if there are many users of that kind it's not like you're solving like problem which is specific to one user you need to have like you know many users which has the same flum then you are much closer to doing a startup and then eventually if you build a product if the product is clicking with a lot of users it's solving a problem what will happen happen that uh things will start falling into place because you you're building something that people want since they want it they love it they will use it they will talk about it they'll tell it to their friends family and more people will come more people will use a product and you will see like a user growth and that's something that you know uh is the most important thing for like you know getting a startup of the ground where there's a product that's growing people are using it so that's something that I always tell people uh to do it and that's what I started doing popular say for example you should start a startup only when everyone is telling you not to do it and you still do it and you're motivated to do it start then you should not do it yeah so even after failing seven times what kept you going uh I think uh uh so it's a combination of few things first uh uh so my father used to my father has a watch shop like he I mean repairs and sells watch I used to uh sit on that shop with him since class third so class think I was decently good at studies my studies were manage so he would like call me on a shop and our like house and Shop is like literally 5 minutes so I would go on his shop and sit with him uh I even used to I still know how to repair a watch I can do like a I learned a lot uh like while working alongside him and uh that time only I learned the importance of Gala right you know in India like we have this you know uh place where we keep all the money so I used to see my father uh I I think saw it uh happening then I used to run the shop my father would go to uh Market to get uh you know things but I would run the shop on my own so I think that thing taught me basics of a business uh it was like a brick and mortar shop but Basics clear so I think that uh inspired me I don't know when it hit me but I was like K I will do something of my own second uh I started uh quizzing in my school days I used to do a lot of it quizzing there was this quiz called TS it wi so I was like a regular participant there and I could never uh I mean win it uh I think uh it was like a very uh prestigious event uh which used to happen Citywide but I learned a lot about Silicon Valley back from then to was say I got like very much interested in computer science I and when I got interested I think I became good at it what show is it uh it's called TCS it it's a program yeah Tata consultancy TCS it Vis so they have like two quizzes TCS it it Vis and Tata Crucible okay so Tata Crucible is for like MBA students thes is for like school students training training it's like a It Quiz National n Nationwide it's a competition that runs and it focuses specifically on it quizzing it's not GK quizzing so uh to that inspired I mean that drove me towards computer and then I was like I mean I'm generally uh generally like to learn new things and I want to do something which is much much much B so that kept me motivating and uh so say I've been taking attempt so each attempt uh was difficult in its own way like co-founders thing not working but what happened that I think there is some some some sort of inner uh Drive uh which is like you know it will happen we we'll figure it out let's you know keep taking attempts uh if you stop taking attempts uh I think that's the biggest mistake that people do make it's hard I'm not saying it's easy it has been hard for me but I also figured out like you know there were few problems that I realized ke maybe like there is like a financial stability in my life that I need to sort so I soled it first yeah I started understanding more deeply about why why should you build a company it's not so I got a lot of ground groundedness from my parents they are very humble uh so I think that kept that also kept me grounded no matter whatever you're doing you always stick to basic and Basics Tey but that's what kept me going so your family always motivated you yeah I mean like they have been a constant source of motivation I think father train I didn't used to like it back then because my other friends would be playing and I would be sitting at a shop with him but now I feel it's so valuable so did you make a plan B it set of savings for like let's say 6 months one year like a plan B savings when you quit your job what was that uh I think uh biggest thing that I learned one of the biggest thing that I learned is but finances mess up when you have like things around you that are dependent on you so what I did was I figured ke uh the reason why uh I figured that startups take longer like I started my journey in October 20122 now it's iig if I can figure out like a decent Runway so that I don't have to worry about at the end of month I don't have this money so that way I felt ke uh it becomes easier then there was this thing key things don't work out account will start going down right but I think that I don't know why but I was like I was very much excited do it figure out but there would be like one company who would take a bet on again and like you work so that will happen so that way I think excellent like I think when you don't have any Plan B you give 120% I think yeah no for sure Plan B will make you weak because you'll always be like same I mean student YouTube channel start I had $300 in my bank account I gave six months to YouTube channel that's why I'm sitting next to you so I think it it has lot of truth to it in the space of AI there are so many competitors coming you know llm also features how do you say how do you stay competitive in this space I think startup like fundamental Advantage which is like you know they move very fast and they're very close to their user so right now I think both of us thankfully are with us we are developers they're building a product for Developers you know this is how this should be built this is how this should be built and then by default uh early pH of startup where like there are few cracked people or there are like few crazy people who are like you know so so much motivated about the problem statement so much motivated about creating an impact that they are doing their 500% th000 percentage and they'll move mountains in just like few hours so I think that's the advantage that any startup has byy I feel like I mean like this is like a new paradigm that has come up nobody knows what will happen so the best uh way to stay competitive is stick to Basics like you know uh just keep the feedback loop tight uh whatever you're are building if you know who your user users are what are their problems and are your is your product addressing that and if you just keep improving the product I think yeah you will survive and you say competitive exactly like I think just like you know pictures in that in that TV show 17 years college student their pendrive say but they still stay strong and still get the funding yeah so I think you saying that you have the power with the best engineers in the team to Pivot at any point of l h I think we'll do whatever is needed for the company to be successful I think yeah that's the Moto and in terms of hiring it said that one to two Engineers who are Top Notch can do the best work rather than 10 average Engineers how do you hire how CTO your team is of four how do you hire the best talent I think the best thing that works for us is we have like a open source project we hired this person called Dave from India we hired pratique from us both of them reached out to us theyve started I wrote about him on LinkedIn and Twitter also in his journey is very Inspire inspiring he's like in a some small town in Gujarat he started contributing all of a sudden to like bzero wow and he was just contributing like I mean no interaction with us he was just making pull request and pull request was getting marged we're giving him feedback he was addressing the feedback and then I just spoke with him and I liked him I was like you know let's figure out if we can collaborate and then we ended up you know getting him full time similarly pratique uh who is based in us uh discovered us like from YC and lingin he reached out to us with a very personalized I mean we are building memory to personalization and his email was one of the best personal personalized emails that we ever saw and it was super clear with why we should hire him like he was upfront in the value that he brings to the team so I feel like open source teams pass like they have like a edge wherein you see like people who are contributing to the repo making it better and if you just talk to them and see if they are at a stage in their life where they can collaborate more deeply with you you can build like a team there and uh that is a good uh way because the engineers or the people that are contributing they've already navigated the code base they know this is how it works they even are contributing without your guidance wow so open source brings so many benefits because when you have the product open source you are making it safe because everyone can contribute so how many developers contributed to your project to become like 22,000 Stars I don't remember the exact number but I think now we have more than 150 at least more than 140 150 contributors out there we have seen contributors from every part of the world uh I mean and this is like such a uh grateful thing for us wherein the world is helping us improve excellent and how do you measure growth so that you can continue grow and like you know get more funding if needed so how do you measure success and growth in your startup I for us uh I mean though we have like a good number of stars but the only thing that we focus on is adding value so right now whatever developers are using our product uh we are just trying to make like a very optimal low latency system for them so that if they add like this memory solution in their product the product experience becomes much much much better their eventual users are happy so they are happy so that's where we are happy so we are it's like a I mean it's very simple for us like our growth is uh the number of users or number of developers that we can make happy because once they are happy their users are happy excellent and last question will be which I asking every founder these days is would you chase success slow and build character or success fast and build ego and exit maybe hypothetically I think is there not a third option there is like uh fast and uh character but there is I think I would for that uh so I I was uh one of the early team members at kabuk and kabuk went like a crazy scale in India one thing that I learned there was like this exact same thing whereing like super super growth mode like Indian Merchants love kabuk a lot and down to earth uh like humble team good ethical people there uh who generally have like I mean they are like one of the smart people I mean a lot of the early team at kabuk was from ID Bombay so very smart Engineers uh I I I think uh uh and still like you know very uh good they taught me like a lot of things a lot of things that I learned in my journey is a combination of things that I did at kabuk also so I would like I mean if I have a choice I would always prefer to build character uh and grow fast yeah excellent excellent thank you thank you so much that I learned a lot go check out mzero it's super useful and thank you so much again and share with the friend who can be inspired to get into y

got into MIT only five to seven students at that time used to get into MIT and there are many other rappers for example Microsoft GitHub co-pilot is a rapper now in 2024 we are reaching the era of Agents when they can actually act like you can you share what are the futures of job in the world of AI you see around you so hello everyone today we have sagnik anupam who needs little introduction because in 2020 he first of all got into MIT only five to seven students at the time used to get into MIT and plus he has been up toate in the era of eii innovation his class work he just explained me that it's up to date even till the Innovations we have seen till gpt3 MIT is very fast moving and we will get to learn more about EI with sagnik so hi sagnik can you please introduce yourself so yeah so hi everyone I'm sagnik um I am a recent graduate from MIT I just graduated a few days ago and I am going to start my PhD at the University of Pennsylvania in fall and uh with a focus in programming languages as well as machine learning so yeah amazing so let's start with three reasons you think that you made it to Mid um all right three reasons okay that's uh I'll have to narrow down a lot of things I think um I think the main reason that I uh feel like really shown through was sort of my Um passion for working on research and working on research projects um when I was in high school I worked on bunch of research projects as well as a bunch of like stem projects that really really interested me and I think that some of those like projects were really really instrumental in my application and talking about what I learned and how I did those projects um I've been working in machine learning since roughly um about 10th grade or so so that's when I first got involved with machine learning and so yeah working on machine learning projects working on um Linguistics and other sort of tangential feeds related to machine learning was sort of the main driving force um in behind like what I did in high school um so yeah that was that I think um obviously I think um marks are important so I would say that I think I had um acceptable marks in my high school so I think I checked off the boxes um regarding that and then um I think finally I think that um a good application like has a powerful essay and like tells a story in a compiling way and um well I I don't have any feedback on my application but I think that it got the job done so um yeah so I basically talked a lot about my passion for machine learning my passion for research um some of the Linguistics um competitions I did like the olympiads and stuff and so that was basically what um and this combination of machine learning and Linguistics is what I mostly put in my application incredible according to the CDs score as well if you have heard common data set for MIT that also says you know academics are top there to get into mid so very well said so can you please share three most inspiring innovations that have recently happened in AI that have influenced you a lot so will preclude that by asking how recent so what's what's recent to you um uh I think last two years you know since the ER of GPD GP right okay um so I think some of the things I'm most excited by um well um the first one is Alpha geometry which is which came out in January I think it's super exciting it is a machine learning model that uses large language models as well as um some traditional symbolic methods and basically uh is able to solve IMO geometry problems which is like which are super super difficult and like um is just a crazy difficult task and the performance that we have seen in those models is is like amazing so I think that's really exciting so um solving IMO math problems using AI um the second sort of main Innovation that I think um was also really exciting so it goes back a bit further um it was using similar techniques for uh program synthesis which is the sort of the task of generating code using machine learning models and um as well as other like traditional methods so I think a good hybrid example of this was dreamcoder and um the third excitement like the exciting project that I discovered was updating dreamcoder using large language models so you swap out the one of the components in dreamcoder using an llm and then you get like amazing boost in performance and that paper was called Lio so Lio dream C and Alpha geometry are sort of the three like advances in AI over the past few years that I think are really cool and really amazing and they sort of like led to each other so dream coders architecture influence Lilo and then um we see like llms being adapted more and more across different tasks so that's where Alpha geometry came in with the math to M so yeah incredible would you define dream coder similar to GitHub co-pilot to generate code I think the main difference in dreamcoder is I think um so copilot is what um I think the architecture of copilot broadly is mostly llm focused and LM based um dreamcoder had a very simple neural network like it is not it does not use billions of parameters it does not use um like a language model at all and the idea behind a incoder is basically to have um like have a neural network that is used for sort of predicting which chunks of code are like good like in terms of solving a particular problem or a particular task but there's like other systems that are working to constantly refactor the code and come up with basically good subm modules and so the main power dreamcoder is not really generating like long strings of code to solve a problem it's basically finding like useful tactics techniques which are these small sub modules that you can chain together in order to like solve like a crazy like big problem so a quick example of that would be like for example if you're trying to device a sorting algorithm the first thing the dreamcoder does is like try to find a simple like sort of piece of code that can like swap different elements in an array together or something right and then you combine those like what what sequence do you do the swaps in what are the conditions under which the swaps Ur and so it keeps iterating on these and sort of filling in these holes until it comes up with a complete starting algorithm from beginning to end and it can do that knowing just like the programming language that you're using and the task that you're like the input and output for the task that you're trying to solve and you would not need to train it on like like you know you don't need to train it on the whole of GitHub you don't need to train it on like all these like large code bases and so I think that's really powerful so it's more of algorithm than Ai and LMS right it is well it is a neuros symbolic model so it uses like a neural network to do the so it has some AI in it but the refactoring is done by algorithms so there's a lot of like program analysis research that is used in order to find what is like a good program or a good solution and what was the third one you said uh so the third one is called Lilo um Lilo substitutes the one of the ideas behind dreamcoder is just enumerating a lot of programs and checking them to make sure that like you know which ones work which ones don't work so the idea is that the large line model is generating some of these um distractions and like writing um like rewriting these code this code so that it becomes more understandable to humans and also helps the model learn how to solve these problems much faster so that's the main idea yeah third part right and then next like token prediction type of task next like token sequence which would complete the program in second type of models you treat a program as something that has holes in it and you're trying to fill those holes function so you fill that in and you keep chaining these functions together like more functional Programming type of approach sequence of functions sequence of functions can solve your task so you can write an insertion sort by chaining function together like you do in list or you can write it like as a python like model and all that so those are the two different approaches so to give some background to the audience so there is you know these llms are based on supervised learning just say up hello or let's say you train a model based on a name like Hello Apple hello orange and now next time you're trying to predict if you just write a it will automatically say apple that's how supervised learning works now you are breaking it down into chunks of code and then training on top of that right so what it can do is it can examine the code it already has in its data set and say it can like generate like if you give it a task like oh generate a sorting algorithm for me it can reference that andite you a sorting algorithm in this case sorting Ali in our training data unsort task which says this is an unsorted AR this is a sorted and that the model can learn to do on what is a good example of a good code so it's discovering programs by itself filling in those holes in those programs and chaining them together so that function call fined now to give some related innovation that are very much connected so 2023 was the era of llms plus their rappers for example perplexity is just a rapper but it has become a unicorn and there are many other rappers for example Microsoft GitHub co-pilot is a rapper now in 2024 we are reaching the era of Agents when they can actually act like you now we haven't reached There Yet now can you share what do you think is the future like is rapper is the highest level of innovation we can imag imagine is Agent or we can imagine even Innovation beyond that level so I think that um well I think rappers can be there's lots of like fine tuning and Architectural stuff going on so I think um there's of course a lot of innovation because um a general purpose large language model might not be the best model for your task you might actually decide that you want to fine tunit more on specific custom data sets or propriety data sets that you have which in turn will like might make like the large language model perform very well on your task so that is a thing that we have constantly been seeing um so for a lot of like for a lot of AI rapper products like it's not simply just a call to like a general large language model so I think that's very exciting that we're going to see more and more about the limits of like fine tuning and what we can actually do in order to overcome those limits and what kind of like data we actually need to overcome those um restrictions on like sort of um what the performance restrictions on general purpose LMS agents on the other hand I think are really interesting because when so there are there's in traditional like sort of optimization Theory you have something known as like swarm intelligence which is this idea where if every if you have a swarm of different agents that are all sort of identified by some variable and they are all working towards the same goal so you have some hyper parameters that are identifying these agents and then they're all working towards the same goal where do they converge is like a very interesting question and this is often used in order to solve optimization problem so if you ever wonder what is like a good architecture for a neural network or if you ever wonder how do you like find the optimal weights and biases of like the neural network these kind of problems have often obviously there are like existing like non swarm intelligence methods but there are also swarm intelligence methods where you just give like a bunch of randomly initialized like sort of Agents a sort of a metric to optimize by and then they converge onto this Optimum metric and that is sorry can you break down swarm intelligent methods I'm sorry I'm not as in touch with the soig basically you have like 30 sort of Agents right you initialize them randomly and then some updating method you update each agent's position um in like sort of 2D suppose 2D space suppose you have like so try to visualize like a bunch of birds basically flying around like so they're flying at random at first right and then what you're doing is you're trying to update it to find what is the best solution graph function which is like I'm trying to find the minimum of this graph which in this Cas is minimum error rate or something some some sort of metric like that mple agents the minimum and they're going to come at the minimum from different positions on this 2D plane randomly initialize different positions over multiple iterations of this eventually convergence possible depending on the function that you're seeing convergence possible then there might be an optimal solution to your entire optimization problem so traditionally Coates but now with LM we have Contex you have one agent Behavior specified in one way you have a second agent Behavior specified in another way and en to find the optimum like value so this has lots of interesting applications to say what is the best newal network architecture what is the solution to this this like longstanding math problem which is like just very very difficult to compute like using traditional methods so you can have all these sort of like challenges which are now like your agents are slightly more intelligent than traditional agents where you just have like a hyper parameter or two simple mathematical function so that is the exciting you mentioned you work on neuros symbolic machine learning models at MIT so can you share the concept of neuros symbolic a and potential advantages and the relationships you have seen between you know how we as human beings are intellectual versus neural networks sure I can try to answer okay so neural net so neuros symbolic AI first of all um is basically this idea that you don't have to do everything through the neural network it is okay to have some symbolic module that is like handling the symbolic aspects of data and what this basically down like p a word I break down neuros symbolic can you break down the whole word thinking about neuros symbolic models right so the neuro part refers to the neural networks or like the sort of the advances in machine learning which we have seen over the past like um I don't know 40 years or so right the symbolic aspect is that you don't have to do everything through the neural network you can choose to have some sort of algorithms or some sort of like previous knowledge that you have about the structure of the data that you're looking at and then use that in order to support the neural network so an example of this for is like simply is just the idea of like trying to generate code right so if you want to generate code through a large language model you're just generating it through whatever you're prompting the llm with but in a neuros symbolic model you have a neural network which can be used to sort of discover like different like sub modules or subprograms that are useful and a symbolic module that is actually like checking them for like you know how good is this like How likely is it to like you know solve this problem does it compile and like all these correctness sort of issues that often pop up when you just give something entirely over to an llm so you don't have to worry about the correctness you don't have to worry about the sort of compilation times and all these like sort of additional metrics that we know from previous uh programming experience before llms but instead the idea is yeah you have one component that handles generation and then one component that handles sort of checking and like validating that the code that you're generating is good oh so it's more like human being like one person is creating like an llm creating code creating language creating intelligence which is in the shape of language and other person is checking so it's like more like an agent model and more similar to human being exactly so yeah so so the benefit of this and the benefit of this approach is of course that you don't have to worry about correctness from the llm side so you don't need to focus on training the llm to sort of um make sure that it's guaranteeing like correct code all the time whereas you can just focus on like you know maybe it can generate small chunks of code like a decent percentage of the time and that's kind of the so your focus shifts and I think a great example of this is the IMO like Alpha geometry which was basically using AI to solve IMO geometry problems so the thing is that there's very little training data compared to like the other tasks that we have on IMO geometry problems because fun fact there are not that many IO geometry problems around right so what what Alpha geometry did was they synthetically generated a bunch of geometric constructions and they analyzed those geometric constructions like exhaustively like just checking you know is this the midpoint of this triang like this side of a triangle is this angle correct like they just analyzed all these random constructions that they generated and then they had an llm generate like like fine tune on this and generate like um more constructions and so it suggested to the sort of the symbolic module to oh put a midpoint here or like you know measure this angle here stuff like that so constructions like that right and then there was a symbolic module that was constantly checking for properties so it was just checking does this midpoint imply that these two are equal like it's using all these geometry theorems that it already knows in order to check the relationships between everything and so this sort of dual pairing where one llm is generating all the constructions and all the extra like geometric information that you need and then there's a symbolic module that is checking that this is useful for the problem this is correct and this is like what kind of new relations does this Inspire and stuff like that and so these two modules working together manag to solve like a very like like just get amazing performance on like the IMO geometry Challenge and that's I think I think that's really really exciting when you split up like the neural aspect and the symbolic aspect like that so that is why I'm excited about neuros symbolic models can it replace humans I think it depends on what replacement um is I think that the I think I try to think about machine learning more in terms of practical like sort of applications so where where do like people um work and like where do like where do these models really really shine um I think we'll always have IM IMO geometry problems around because humans like challenging themselves and humans like solving this um I think that at the end of the day we're going to see that a lot of um a lot of challenging problems can be augmented by Machine learning models but I'm not quite sure that um we are at a point where we will always get 100% accuracy on every single task ever so I think I think it's a matter of time it's it's sort of too early to say right now about like what exactly can be replaced and what cannot be replaced but I think over time what we're going to find out is um we have some models that are amazing at some specific tasks and others that are not so I think it's just going to um end up in terms of like that so so it's going to be very task specific let's zoom out a little bit into AI projects can you share what are the most interesting and useful AI projects and usefulness of AI you see around you is it AI agents multimodality because Nvidia CEO just said that every country needs to have its own large language model Spanish Hindi Punjabi or you know marati Telo every language needs to have their own model so that we can build up on the multimodality and make many models perfect so so yeah um I think that in general when I'm thinking about like um how Global like AI has become and like how we are seeing all these sort of like um local languages that are like you know have their own llms now I think um some of the most exciting uses for me at least are like um especially I feel like we can do problems like translation and like problems like just just massive like text problems that were just not doable at that scale before like you can understand like a lot about like um you know massive amounts of textual data that is being gathered but I think what's more exciting is that llms also have like promising sort of um like we' seen that llms have a lot of promise even in data that's not strictly like Text data so for example if you have like data like for example programs right code or equations and you're seeing these sort of like these new approaches that are coming up in order to solve problems in these domains I think that is what personally is most exciting for me so when you have like models that have like so much language like trained on so much language data like how do they perform on like other tasks and how how do they understand like non-textual like sort of tasks and also how do they like what kind of like information are they collecting from the rest of the data set so for example if you try to like take an llm to play like chess for example right it obviously has a lot of data related to like chess games but it also has a lot of data related to like the individual profiles of the chess players themselves so like what does it know about like and I use know in the sort of the loosest way possible but like what can it figure what kind of relationships can it figure out between like certain opening moves versus like certain like in-game moves like like what's this relation and what's this Dynamic and those things are really I think exciting to think about because so far like a lot of problems that we've seen before LMS have just been you have this one data set that has like these kind of it has a lot of these input variables and you have that output variable so yeah so you have you have a lot of this data the model just looks at the input variables that we think are good for the output variable but then in a post LM word what excites me is that now we have a lot of like language data that it's been collected from a lot of different sources so how do you use that and then sort of like approach this traditional problems that only had like you know Jess moves or only had like medical records and like only had these like sort of individual ual like sort of sort of non-text data so what kind of like relations can you find out between them so yeah yeah incredible answer now what are the three dangers of adversarial attacks AI dangers you have seen around you and what you have done to stop them sure um okay what I've done to stop them is well your Pap try it so I think a basic one for example is data poisoning right so if you're input data or raining data is just not working the way it is so if someone has obviously like maliciously modified it or if someone has like or if just by oversight you have just missed some component data that's not the way it should be there's a huge chance you can generate something that is like problematic or that is like dangerous and um sometimes things might just end up breaking and so let me add an example a quick example is just now GPD 40 was jailbroken and there's a prompt created that can enable GPD 40 to in fact tell you how to create bombs tell you you know destroy the world that was so dangerous yeah go ahead sorry yeah so so yeah so I think that's like that's a very interesting aspect of this where I think that yeah so finding out prompts like that or finding out stuff like that can have really bad impacts on you know end users and often times like people will be using models in different context right and we are seeing this more and more with llms that were initially released as these sort of like chat Bots and chat agents and they have just grown to be so much more than that like I'm see LMS being used um for like Robotics and for like um for for language instructions for solving like programming problems math and all of that so what happens if you have like an llm that generates bad code or like broken code or like you know deploy has some security vulnerability that no one notices and these are all problems that are really really challenging and I think these can happen through like both like yeah so obviously you have data poisoning you also have people like adversly prompting uh and prompt engineering these llms to produce that kind of stuff um and I think these kind of attacks are just like um really really problematic what to do to stop them I think is just like being really really careful and having like a system of checks and balances in order to like make sure that your model is outputting what you want it to output and I think that recent advances in like tackling these sort of issues are like really really exciting to read about so you have like um you obviously have like manual filters or like you know so like the most primitive form ofage is like certain phrases or certain proms that just block from like occuring but I think that like fine tuning models on specific things to avoid as well as like reinforcement learning from Human feedback where like a human is in the loop and is trying to like tell the model like oh this is a good output this is a bad output like those kind of like sort of intensive work being done on the model can help it prevent from like and specifically speaking to large language models can help it prevent from like prevent the model from generating this kind of text so I think that um personally that like um yeah we're going to see a lot of like like adversarial attacks are now part of our reality and like we are going to see a lot of them and I think that mitigation techniques are just going to evolve with them so it's going to be like um the old cyber security versus like hacker um like sort of dynamic where every new exploit needs a batch and then every new batch can like lead to a new exploit potentially and someone needs to check that and so I think we're going to see a lot of that in the AI world as well true another example could be like you know in your training set someone can add a stop light a stop sign as a green light you know if it's a self-driving car so you know these are very dangerous any other dangers you've seen I think a fun one was uh when a checkered car like a car with a checkered and so it was not even being identified as another car it was being identified as like an object that's completely unrelated and I think that's like a dangerous example of like why how like you know if you're not really really not careful about your data you can um you can end up with misclassification issues I think another fun one was I think if you add some noise to the image of a band there were some um image like classification models that identified a panda as a given and um I think that while you know the day-to-day dangers of misclassifying a panda are not that severe I think that some poor Wildlife um Enthusiast is going to be very very sad um with that happening so yeah I think that there's there's definitely interesting like sort of issues around that and um yeah mitigation is just going to be a challenge coming going forward into like the future years let's come back to MIT MIT doing everything amazing in the era of innovation for example you are up to date in your classwork from gpt3 till now what has happened you are up to date from Transformers from the first research paper that came out in the in in the era of llms that was you know attention is all you need so these are things that other universities not just in other countries like Africa India or China but even in the US I if I go to even like you know Georgia state Georgia Tech ASU they are they also take longer than my team to stay updated they also sometimes are not up to date they just say yeah ke go to go to corsera study from there they are not at at the speed of MIT so what are the things that student can do to match the level of Excellence of MIT sure um I think that like on on the first point I think um yes it takes time for things to come into coursework I think that's just the progress of science so um I think we're going to see more and more of like um I think in a world where we have digital learning like as a possibility we're going to see a lot more of people incorporating like all sorts of digital articles research papers you know Cutting Edge development into their curriculum and I think that um this is something that's just going to keep growing so I think that the way things are today may not be the way things are you know even four years into the future where people going into college today are going to be graduating so I think there's a lot of potential like sort of um like I have a lot of excitement around like more and more like sort of you know reagin reimagining of the curriculum as it exists so we're going to see like a lot of exciting engineering discoveries being talked about in the classroom and so that's personally something that's very exciting for me um I think for students I think that the general thing that helped me was uh so MIT also puts a lot of his cours work online on open courseware um so it's ocw.mit.edu there's a lot of like helpful stuff from our classes from our ranging from like lecture videos to lecture notes to like textbook recommendations and stuff so I think that um if you want like an education like where you are sort of like pursuing all the stem stuff that like you know other students at other universities are pursuing honestly the easiest way is just to like look up what people are talking about at the in that course or what other the topics that are being covered in those courses so you can just search those topics up yourself and like read about more about them so I think um I think one of the best ways that I sort of like learned about different topics at Mid was just looking like finding something that a professor like randomly mentioned in a class or something and being like oh that sounds really interesting and then I go back and then I'm looking up like what is this about and then before I know I'm on some like lecture slide from some other university and I'm just reading about that particular like Niche topic and I think that sort of learning is really really helpful it helps you discover like a lot of different things going on not only in computer science but in other fields as well um it also helps you like understand the history of what's going on in your classes so like especially in like at least I can only speak to computer science and math which is sort of the the majors that I pursued at MIT but in my um in my classes a lot of things I feel were like better contextualized I understood why it's important to study them and like why we got to this point where we are talking about this in the classroom because not all papers and not all like key ideas sort of make it into textbooks or or discussed there's just too much research going on and there's a lot going on right so understanding where this came from and what the field was like when this idea was published and how it changed the field is like really really exciting to learn about so I think that's something that um you know is amazing and I think for courses in general I think pursuing courses were your like sort of instructor is like um sort of like this is their passion this is their course like you know is is something is amazing I had the privilege to take like classes where which was basically like what you would call as someone's specialty so the instructor had basically done like years of research on this one topic they were teaching like a specific um like sort of uh insight into their like how do you get introduced to that kind of work or how do you get introduced to that kind of research and so they have all these cool ideas and these cool tidbits that they will mention in class where uh you know you're just learning about what is new in the field what has been some new development in the field and because they're up to date on the literature is really exciting to learn that so I feel like for every University obviously has like different like sort of people with different specializations and people whose research interest are very different but taking classes where the specialization and the professor's like own research field sort of like intersect with this course material is like super super rewarding in my opinion so I think that was just amazing so yeah so so you mentioned for students they can start with mit's course workor they can continue to learn whatever whatever information that is new in that cour work explore go in depth into it now how can institutions can get better can can be at the level of MIT I think that generally I think so there are a few things that institutions can do which I think were like sort of like the most like rewarding aspects of my undergraduate experience I think the the the most rewarding experience by far that M provided was something called the undergraduate research opportunities program um I participated in it every single semester of my time at MIT I was just constantly like working with someone or the other on some project um and I think that was really really cool because a lot of like a lot of research work that you get exposed to is often not research work that you just like stumble across one day right it's it's because someone talks to you about it it's because someone like gives you like sort of some some sort of mentorship and like some sort of help in terms of how do you get introduced to the field and I think that the mentors and the the research opportunities that I had at MIT were fantastic I think that the people who supported me here were like amazing and they provided very thorough like sort of explanations and introductions to like their particular specialization and I think that just having that sort of like close like one-on-one time with an individual mentor and individual researcher is like so so helpful and I think that um more universities should have such kind of opportunities for undergraduate research I love to see like you know like there there are like whole like nowadays there are like whole conferences dedicated to undergraduate research and just undergraduate research and that's really really exciting for me to see because that is what shaped most of my ID experience so I think that's the by far the biggest one um I think in terms of Education I also think that like having sort of these there's so many like sort of optional classes and electives at Mid that are just you know super cool and just like super exciting to think about so when you're flipping through the course catalog you you really are spoiled for choice or like oh I want to take this class I want to take that class this class is only being offered this one like sort of like once every two years or so and it's being taught by someone who's like absolutely like you know the last four papers they published were on this topic right so I think that like really tying like classes together with people's specializations is like really what makes like a department like you know feel like home to the students like feel where students get excited about the classes that they're taking because I think that um I I think that in general like taking these kind of classes or offering these kind of classes is very very cool um and also I think updating them frequently is also like super important like I've seen classes that have like you know that were taught one way when I started at MIT and by that now that I'm graduating and watching other people take this class it's totally different like I can't even recognize it and that's sort of like even within four years that level of like drastic change is like um I think it just speaks to like how how passionate sometimes like professors are about like teaching students like what's new in the curriculum like what's new in research and I think that's like super um just just super amazing in general like I think that it like yeah that that sort of dedication and that sort of like passion is just um you know it makes students feel excited about the subject and at least like many people I know who did undergraduate research did it because they were interested in a topic because a professor like talked about it in a class and they went up to the professor afterwards and they talked to the professor about that topic and like ended up like doing a research on that topic like that is something that happens way more often um than you would think it does and like and it's just so amazing to see yeah totally agree the earlier you start the better you become I can I can totally say that people who are starting now at sixth grade into AI seventh grade it might be funny for some people but they are becoming better AI researchers there are there surely like a pattern people who start early are becoming better Engineers people are becoming better AI researchers programmers Engineers now you're going for your PhD can you share what are the futures of job in the world of AI you see around you yeah sure um so yeah so I think um I think that AI is definitely like I've seen a lot of people like working at AI companies and a lot of like uh new postings for AI researchers and AI scientists and um just I think there's a lot of potential and that the field is really growing I think personally for me I think um so some of the different ways I've seen people get involved is often you can like have like a machine learning internship at a startup where you're basically just building out their pipeline um for solving like a particular machine learning problems I think those are like some of the internships you'll see uh like being posted a lot I think more more and more companies have dedicated like machine learning Engineers who are working on like massive systems that already exist in the company and they're improving efficiency they're improving speed they're improving performance and all of those things are like really really like exciting because you're tackling machine learning from like a systems perspective you're tackling it from a hardware perspective you're tackling it from like really really lowlevel like um code perspective so it's really really exciting to like look at someone approach machine learning from all these different angles right so all of these different positions are dropping up um I think that um there's also more interest in like having dedicated like ml research scientist teams who are working on like Innovations in areas where um you know like particular companies are really really interested in so you now you have people with image teams you have um sort of multimodal like Vision text teams you have all these sort of research teams that like you know even a few years ago like the postings for that were like very very few and now like a lot of Industries are really excited about machine learning and they're trying to um hire a lot of good like um individuals who are like interested in working in those areas so in General I think that um I think that like in general there are a lot of opportunities in machine learning I think that um well yeah I think the PHD aspect of it is just like I think yeah that that that's not something I can really speak to because I I haven't finished right I haven't looked at the PHD postings in too much detail yet so I feel like that's just a yeah yeah jobs are popping crazy but the difficult part is people are choosing AI Engineers who just learned how to train train an llm in 2023 2024 over someone who has an llm experience of 2016 that is how fast it is changing you you you said it right and your PhD degree right now or your MIT degree right now or your knowledge right now is more important than someone's machine learning knowledge 5 years ago it's that crazy and you're right that we have to every single year there's no there's no shortcut to hard work you have to have to show experience which is the latest right you agree I think um yeah I think um well I will say that like some amount of like longevity in the field is important like um I think a lot of um experienced like researchers in AI are finding a lot of renewed interest in their works so I think that being in AI for a long period of time is definitely like helpful but um with that being said I I just think there's generally just more openings in general which are hiring for like different levels of experience so I think that for certain like roles um employers don't really like see um having a PhD as that necessary for what they're trying to do and what kind of models they're trying to build whereas um in other kind of roles they're just looking to like open up teams and like have like research scientists lead those teams so I think you know I really think that it's just like whatever fits for the company and whatever works for the company um in Kashi so yeah do you think we're going to go into the future of more tokens being processed because it's impossible for example Gemini introduced their 2 million token window 2 million to token context that means you can put 10 python libraries that a human cannot learn in a in months or years you canar learn in one minute using those those context Windows do you believe future is even bigger I think that yeah we're definitely going to see like bigger more and more context Windows like I think a lot of exciting research is going on in that area um I also think that like we are also seeing interesting research in the other direction which is what you want to shrink your models so that they run locally on your phone on your laptop and stuff like that so I think that a lot of research is also going into like figuring out what how how to make models work well and those those context so I think you know I think there are many different ways machine learning as a field is evolving and I think those are really exciting so yeah sure and last any final advice scho student he like you know treats you as a wants toer the world so first of all but follow your passions definitely pursue it as much as you can school school whatever opportunities you getting like learn more about science learn as much as you can and participate in competitions where like um you know you get to do research you get to do projects you get to like show like your science knowledge and like share science with the rest of the world and I think that in and out of itself College like satisfy um and I think another piece of go on go on like search like enrichment opportunities online and stem enrichment opportunties sumam summer camps and often times like you know they don't even have like Financial cost is like a barrier pursue these kind of opportunities as much as you can there are olympiads in linguistics and philosophy which are like becoming more and more popular nowadays and India sending teams there so like participa in those kind of competitions and it's yeah it's just you know just enjoy your high school like your middle school and high school years in general like colleges look for like across the board they look for um like passion and dedication to your subject though a specific College I'm not to say this so and totally starting early is important age is not a barrier age barri alcohol but not for learning you can learn as early as possible absolutely yeah awesome thank you so much sagnik it was wonderful talking to you got so many insights into the into the era of AI Innovation that I had never heard about learned so much and I going to do my homework going

there's such high demand for this field like I  would say 90% they got internships really yeah   so hello everyone today we have umber here he's  going to explain the industry no one is talking   about because he is part of the semiconductors  industry one of the most Recession Proof industry   in the US right now and batchmates are 90%  in apple nid or AMD right because recession   May software Engineers were not getting calls  he was someone and his friends in electronics   communication LSI semiconductors were getting  the calls so hi Amber can you please introduce   yourself hi so my name is Amber and I'm I'm  finally a student in at Jo Tech and I'm pursuing   electrical and computer engineering so my interest  primar lies in uh physical design or vsi design   which is essentially converting logic into uh  actual tape out ready uh layouts H Tap Out is so Step before TSMC as it gives you a ready fabricated chip you have to send them a design Earlier they used to make designs on a tape Now we have server farms we send .GDSII file Earlier actual disk tapes were used to save the date. we used to read the tapes to fabricate Tape out is getting the Chip out So this is i7 layout, cores are there, we send this image to TSMC and they send this chip out We can put this now directly on Laptops, Phones etc fabrication how you became aess expert back  undergr Electronics so why undergrad electronics   and what experience you had how you got interested  in it I started my bachelor with the mechanical   and uh like in my first year I realized that I'm  really good at electrical like naturally I was   good at electrical engineering and electronics  how did you figure out that uh because all my   friends everyone around me was struggling with  electrical and I got like a straight A oh yeah   and it was like people were like actually failing  it was not even like it was getting PC people were   failing and a lot of people even Studios people  were like at C or B and I was just naturally at   a I didn't find it challenging and I really found  it interesting that uh okay you can solve circus   like this so uh for me that was just like uh one  indicator that okay I'm good at this uh and in   my second year like I was doing this buggy project  right we have that uh in undergrads so uh like for   me it was like uh actually fun to design the logic  like IR all the sensors interfacing them with the   microcontrollers it was actually fun so I was  like you know this is what I want to do I don't   want to do mechanical uh so in my second year  I switched to electronics and in my final year   I like during that placement time right I was uh  interested in software because like all my friends   were in software so uh like everyone was talking  about software and there was a bubble in 2021 that   software jobs were paying a lot tier 2 tier three  College 50 LH package like it was highly bloated   because just Co everyone was hiring right because  everyone was like there's going to be a lot of   demand so uh like I also was like okay everyone's  doing that so let's do this I didn't even know   about vs I didn't even know about 7 industry uh  and then like uh I think arm came to our campus   and I got sh listed for the uh interview like I  didn't even prepare for the test and I cleared   the test so for me that was like an indicator okay  like and that's the first time I got to know that   okay this is actually an industry so then like  I really tried for semi but I didn't get it so   uh I started as a software engineer Samsung  right and then soon after like I left my   software engineering job for an internship uh  at Cadence Cadence Cadence is in chips yeah so   Cadence is an edate company it designs a software  uh but I was in the IP design team of cadence so   we would we would design our own IPS and property  intellectual property intellectual property and   sell it to other company so basically chips  sell correct correct so we make our own chips   and sell it to other companies so uh uh I I  did an internship there then I got converted   and then I worked there for 1 year right so  that was like total 2 years approximately and   uh then like I realized that like I need to move  into uh like uh I would say the core IP design   uh part of this job so like there were a lot of  opportunities in us and us is like the uh mecca   for semicondctor design so that's why like I  wanted to learn from the best and that's why   made the decision to do my masters of course like  P World key I think 90% of the chips are designed   anyway AB yeah so like when you switch from  Samsung to Cadence was it because of your passion   for chips yeah absolutely I I mean I I was I was  decent at software engineering cuz I I actually   took uh electronics and computer engineering so in  my undergrad I did like I I I did some CS courses   as well and I was decent at programming and I have  been programming since I was like I think uh 15   or 16 oh yeah like since 11th like I had been uh  coding so I was decent at uh programming but then   again like my national uh inclination was towards  Electronics so what was absent in Cadence Cadence   you felt like going to us coming to us so so I  mean I was in uh analog uh design analog layout   so there it's like full custom and it's pretty  like uh it's a it's more like uh it's a very   laborious task I would would say it's like just  uh creating custom chips and I wanted to automate   some part of it and since I knew programming  and so that's like the benefit of having this   like uh extended skill set where you also have uh  programming skills along with electrical skills so   then like I could use uh my programming skills to  automate some tasks and I learned some tasks like   I I tried to automate some stuff but I was like I  want to like uh go fully into this and to upskill   myself I had to do my masters I see and by the  way doo in the US I have been using the world's   largest bank called The Chase Bank and if you see  the transaction history I was charged $12 in the   month when my balance was less than $1,500 and  $15 when I received the incoming wire transfer   from India because of that I decided to switch to  a startup which is recommended by Rice University   and University of Buffalo's website for all  students and even non- students can use it   immediately because it charges you0 nothing when  you receive money from India or anywhere from 95   countries worldwide and you know receiving money  outside of United States charging $15 on other   Banks can add up to hundreds of dollars over years  and you can save up immediately with just one step   and if you switch to it first of all it allows  you to get credit history 1% cash back every time   you use it instantly plus an ability to apply  without social security number when you are in   India you can use it and many students have used  it as proof of Finance when they apply for Visa   by showing money in their adro accounts go ahead  and check out adro because you will get $50 with   my link in description below when you spend  $50 after depositing 500 to your account go   check out right now excellent so let's start with  vsi what does it stand for and little bit about   the industry you are working in sure so vsi stands  for very large scale integration which essentially   means that uh putting about roughly about million  to billion transistors uh on chip right so uh   the task of doing that is essentially called vsi  and it starts from uh the architecture level so   you'll hear about like CPUs and gpus right so  those are architectures which are essentially an   implementation of an Isa Isa Isa is uh instruction  set architecture mhm so for example you know uh   windows 64 right yes uh or Mac OS or you have  uh like arm now also so you'll see like recent   laptops they have arm 64 in them G so arm 64 is  an Isa it's an in instruction set architecture   which essentially a language now someone needs  to write something in that language right so   people who write in those language are called  uh implementation Engineers so or uh different   companies have different implementations for  example arm has its own implementation which it   sells in terms of ips and you won't believe this  almost every company buys arm licensed IPS for   millions of dollars so that's how they've made a  business out of it like like no chip right now is   without arm like if you want low power chips you  need arm in it so IP is have kind of patterns uh   not in uh vsi IPS mean uh chips like uh IP codes  like intellectual property so it'll be like a   block okay that a particular company will Design  and sell it for millions of dollars so for example   for example let's say you're talking about uh  Microsoft they want to make a server chip right so   they need one part which is like low power memory  or low power uh or power management IC right   so they'll essentially buy it from some other  company like maybe infinion or even nxp or TI   and they'll pay like millions of dollars for that  oh yeah so so so this is how it works so designs   are the most valuable asset right absolutely yeah  I think I was watching you know the interview of   irin sasan who is like the C of perplexity  he said that like you know everything is at   the end of the day a rapper for example Nvidia  is a rapper of what TMC is creating design is a I think like shining in this industry that also  shows that's an IP right that's a you know $30,000   gpus absolutely so let's start with the basic  little bit let's start with complete basics for   students watching so let's say we have a CPU and  then we have a GPU so CPU can you share what are   the kind of skills you use what what is happening  right now in your industry so okay so CPU um   essentially it's a very uh like I would say  um consumer Focus market so uh you have like   consumer Focus CPUs for example Intel has its  own an EMD and like whenever we go like we want   to buy the latest like apple has its own M2 and  M4 so uh that's one segment then there's another   segment which is server CPUs so those are like  for heavy load tasks right a CPU is essentially   uh like processing information and data right  so uh any task that you sort of want to perform   on a server it will get queued in the CPU and  for example let's say I I open chat GPD and I   want to uh send a request for an inference so  it'll first queue that request using the CPU   and then send it with the gpus gpus are three  dimensional right right so so uh yeah so you   can say that like it's a brain versus Braun  right braw is like the strength and brain is   like the one that's actually doing the control  of uh or managing the tasks so uh the CPU will   manage all the tasks and schedule it for the brawn  which is the gpus so then gpus will do it uh like   will process the information in parallel right  but CPU cannot do that correct yeah so I think example let me speed it up 4 3 2 1 H so let's say you are painting a big  picture right and if you do with a CPU you will   maybe just paint the nose and like eyes but with  GPU the whole picture whole face can be painted   just at one time a gun gun gun off a paint and  you paint the whole thing all at once whenever   we talk about CPUs and gpus we really need to  talk about Moors law so Moors law in which you   know transistors double every 18 months like look  roughly 2 years but every 18 months transistors   double so the performance doubles as well  absolutely so can you elaborate where does   it come from the history of it and where are we  right now with this law okay so so uh there's this   engineer uh uh at Intel who like who co-founded  Intel called G Mo so he released the paper which   essentially in which he mentioned that or he  just observed that uh given the trend uh every   like the number of chips on number of Trans on a  ship they're doubling roughly 12 months right and   he predicted that in the future this trend will  continue and he predicated that uh theory on the   basis of that uh like engineering effort will  improve over the years so Engineers will keep   on improving this technology and we will see this  uh rise in number of transistors on a chip so it's   also called transistor density or chip density  so uh what is a transistor okay so transistor   is essentially like a switch right uh it's like a  tap so when you uh want to say that okay uh it's   either on or off right so like a tap like it's  either on or off when it's on water flows through   it right and water could be like water essentially  just electrons right but uh what it does is that   for example in memories uh the way it used is that  since we have a binary function 0 or one right   it's on or off so that's where the binary comes  from and data can flow zero or one one so now   now you can store data in terms of Z and one in  a transistor and that's just memory now when you   look at like other parts of logic so for example  uh when you're looking at a like let's say Coss   which is a complimentary Moss so it's it's just  like a logic gate so logic gate what you want is   Boolean algebra right like uh one and one should  be one uh and stuff like that so for that also uh   you can use transistors to drive that logic and  that is a very beautiful uh sort of uh method   in which by which like uh this thing happens  where uh you can actually create logic using these   transistors and and that's how boan algebra was uh  like it came into the picture now the question you   explained Mo pretty well right and transistors  double but how do they double can you go in   depth of it with so there are a lot of methods the  most uh like basic method would be essentially to   reduce the size of transistor right a so so that  is the most difficult thing to do uh right now now   especially because if you look at like the number  of like the size of transistors over the years uh   even now like uh there are companies operating at  45 nanom right but now we have reached like 1.8   nanom and 2 Nan n yeah Nom CHS us becoming smaller  abely so but the problem is uh the diameter of   silicon atom is 2 Ang strong2 okay so or I would  say like the diameter of uh silicon atom is2 nanom   uhhuh and now we have reached a gate length of  1.8 nanom right so we are that is the limit right   and there are other limits as well because now  you're at the edge of uh designing or at the edge   of engineering right you've reached the limits so  now people are coming up with new transistors as   well like instead of the traditional transistors  now they're coming up with new transistors like   you have gate all around fed and people are also  looking at Carbon nanot tubes people are looking   at different material as well so you have gallan  nitr and all those things so uh apart from that   like even if you look at like how uh we broke  this limit for example we used to have planer   uh fets or something which is like two dimensional  right and then we broke that into uh fin fet where   we had added a three Third Dimension to the  transistor so finfet finfet uh the name came   because like there's a fin in the transistor  so finfet uh and Technologies like these they   essentially cause musla to uh keep growing or they  continue MOS we make it three dimensionals just   like gpus are also threedimensional so that's how  like MOS definitely applies to gpus as well CPUs   as well all the this is this is what is driving  the uh the growth and performance in CPUs and gpus   like if we didn't create a new transistor with  each generation there won't be any performance   benefits so that's why we see these performance  benefits like if you compare a chip of like let's   say 2024 with a chip of 2017 let's say 7 back  you'll see a dramatic uh change in performance   like and that is partially due to uh the change in  technology as well and why does it happen only in   18 months we understood so far a trans smallest  size possible is 1.8 nanometer so how do we only   be able to do it in 18 months I mean that's just  an observation so it's just a number because uh   that is what the trend was and another like I  would say this is my opinion this is my reason   like my understanding uh which which is that uh if  you look at like how much time it takes to make a   new chip uh the turnaround time is around 2 years  or like 1.5 years yeah it's not like software   where you can like uh quickly make a new product  and ship it right so the whole process like from   uh like the architecture to implementation it  takes uh around 1 and a half to 2 years so that's   why now you explained everything so well now let's  talk about the tech Stacks what do you do in terms   of software Hardware to make it possible to to  possibly Implement Mo's law to possibly double   down the transistors to build Hardware so what  do you do so so I would say that there are like   uh four major uh Stacks or four major like uh  areas one is architecture right architecture is   like people who design these CPUs and gpus uh who  create the uh architecture for that then there's   people who translate this architecture into logic  logic means Gates right so that is done through   RT design which is transfer level uh so in that  like you use verilog and system verog these are   programming languages so these are Hardware  so these are called hdls Hardware description   language so uh using them they're like C++ only  so now actually uh they are new things coming up   like system C uh for verification so system C is  essentially similar to C like you have oops you   have all the concepts of uh basic programming it's  just that now you're designing for Hardware right   so that is one thing uh then you have like um if  you go like below that logic uh below that level   then you have uh verification like verification  is now verification usually like solid programming   skills where you need like system ver log C++  C uh depending on which thing you're verifying   right sometimes people need to also learn um  like openg GL bucon uh in order to verify gpus   because because what you're trying to do is you've  designed the logic uh let's say the logic is for a   Shader right of a GPU now you want to verify that  whether that Shader works or not right so you want   to render something what is Shader by the way like  I don't think I have a lot of knowledge it's just   the part of uh like for example you know openg  open okay okay so it's like U um how do I say um   all the games right they run on uh these uh so so  when whenever a GPU renders a game right it needs   a translation language right so these things  open G Von all these things and shaders also   they they help uh sort of translate this code  into yeah basically okay so the these are the   tools basically convert code into functionable  Hardware right that's what it's saying okay so   these are the tools like um H I'll just actually  back up about uh Von vcan is like a programming   language only okay so uh C++ like they just use it  to create like how do I say modules which can be   used in testing but essentially uh you are using  like hdls which diens like system verilog verilog   uh vhdl or system C that's one level then you have  verification which also uses the same languages   and uh cc++ uh and then there's another uh like  level which is uh physical design now physical   design is essentially translating this logic which  you design in RTL uh to uh actual layouts which   will be sent to fabrication units I see so they  will be sent to tsmc so now this this area like I   would say like you would need electrical skills  like uh for example you need to know circuits   you need to be really good at circuits because  there'll be a lot of uh RC ladders like resistance   and capacitance right all those uh we had tanin  and Norton laws so your electrical should be   really good and then like uh once you're good  with the electrical Basics like RCS and of course   you need to know about transistors so uh I  would say mosfets like reading up on mosfets   there's this really nice book by Kang uh which is  called seos I think seos by Kang mosat so moset   is uh metal oxide semiconductor Field Effect  transistor it's like a it's like a transistor   okay so all these things the abbreviation like uh  these things just mean just explain like how the   transistor Works essentially is a switch so using  these switches using 01 we create the world of B   which creates the world of architectures so for  example you have 32bit 64bit what does it mean it   means that the instruction isn't 32 bits so you  need 32 transistors like 32 uh zeros and ones to   decode the instruction right so more number of  bits you have uh more information you can encode   so that's why like you'll see that 64bit will  have more sort of uh granularity granularity   over the uh sort of os so uh talking about your  physical design you need like electrical skills   you need mosfet transistors and all those things  then another interesting aspect of this is uh that   you need to know like uh I would say coding  so your programming should be good like this   is this is a very sort of uh underscored area  that people don't mention people just say that   like you know for vlsi you need to know electrical  and electronics and people just say that oh you're   from Electronics electrical right but like in our  field in every stage that I mentioned you need   algorithms every field and I'm not just talking  about basic like gry algorithms I'm talking about   graph programming as well oh there there is  graph so so uh all these companies there's   these companies called Eda companies or electronic  design automation okay so these these companies   create the software for our tools so so our tools  the tools that we use right uh there are some   tools in especially in art field like physical  design where you need to like uh draw the shapes   or uh put these cells together right in order  to make make a proper layout so there you need   you need these tools like uh Eda software so these  Eda tools uh they use all these things like graph   partitioning and uh like divide and conquer along  with graphs because now you're looking at let's   say if it's a very simple problem for example if  I say that there are two cells right and you want   to Route them so it's like you can say that it's  like a similar problem to the ones that we had   in DSA like uh there's start Point there's an end  point you go through all possibilities right you   do a recursion and you so it's like that so uh we  need to know those skills because our tools work   on are built on um like algorithms okay so we need  to know algorithms as well and then there's one   coding Pro uh language called tickle and tickle  and pearl so tickle is TCL and then there's Pearl   p r l uh or python python is like the staple like  industry yeah her industry exactly so for example   like if you want to present any data right we need  python we need because in every field like we we   if we can save let's say one% I so I I made  a I would say like so the in last semester I   made a presentation in a packaging course which is  essentially 3D IC packaging so uh my presentation   was that meta was set to buy I think 30,000 uh  h100 gpus from Nvidia okay they have bought the   highest around 200,000 Nvidia gpus they bought  so they they have their future demand and now   also they have bought like 30,000 h100 gpus each  one costs like uh around I think 20,000 I'm not   sure 25,000,000 right so I made a case that uh  I I I calculated the number for Atlanta's power   right like the power in kilowatt hours right how  much uh amount does it like in dollars how much   does it cost and I say that if you can reduce the  power consumption of each h100 GPU by 10% you'll   ENT I think it was uh $ 1.4 or $2 million that  you can save annually oh my God right that's 1   yeah million 2 million one okay $1.2 million yeah  you can save and that is just from 30,000 GPU now   imagine like server Farms right using uh so many  gpus for for each uh CH GPT inference you need   like so many gpus and so that's why I feel like  this field is pretty solid and like uh there'll   always be a demand to make power efficient chips  which actually save all these companies all these   software companies like meta and Microsoft money  New York City The energy needed is 5 gaw hours   right now that is the amount of energy all the AI  GPU compute from all the companies in the US need   in the next 5 years that is the prediction made as  for the source the newsletter I follow called the   information and that is insane so I think really  need to cut down the cost absolutely that's why   that's why this this feeli like uh there's such  high demand for this field uh like it it is I   agree that it needs a lot of skill uh to enter uh  and like even now like when I uh I I play soccer   so like I I meet some people so they they talking  to me like about the career Affairs and all so uh   they were asking me like how come like you know  uh this field is good like your field is good so   I was explaining to them and they're like how can  we enter this field and he was like a CS major so   uh I was like you know you actually can like there  is there is a big uh skill required to enter the   market but you can say like a CS student with not  much about semiconductor industry knowledge or   vssl vsi VLS vsi vsi okay not much vsi knowledge  how can they enter right so I feel that uh this a   like a positive news for computer science students  they already have the basic skills which is uh   programming and data science so data science is  very big like you need to uh use data science to   actually prove your theories right so if you're  saying that I'm going to save this much power you   need to figure out for example uh let's say you  have billion chips a billion transistor on a chip   right you can't verify each single transistor  that whether this is going to save power or not   so you have to do like some approximations and  that's where data science comes into the picture   so you need data science you need algorithms that  I mentioned that algorithms are a staple of this   industry right so they have those skills another  interesting skill that they already possess is   operating systems right so these are like staple  computer science courses and it's actually nice   because uh if you know operating systems you can  make the jump to uh I would say architecture cuz   it's like just it's linked through this uh so  computer architecture is called like Hardware   software uh code design mhm right because it's  it's a code design of software and Hardware   where you're saying that okay this is how this  is the language in which the software is going   to interact with the hardware so so that's how  uh they can enter computer architecture and if   of course like if they want to move into let's  say logic design or physical design they would   require like uh basic electrical knowledge so  it it doesn't take that much time like maybe a   few months to just know the basics like how do  how does a transistor work uh what's cosos uh   how does logic like uh how a logic gets formed  using seos logic right and once you understand   these things like it's actually uh pretty fun  to understand so once you understand those uh   I think like you're all set to join this industry  problem for example like you you want to look at   documentation a programmer looks at documentation  all are available like but if you want to find   documentation for ver logs right very log s logs  it's a big challenge absolutely and is I just saw   a why YC backed startup of an 18-year-old who  I'm possibly interviewing Su as well so he's   developing a way in which you just name a verog  file or a cisl file documentation okay yeah so   which is really useful for like you know that's  hardware Engineers people that n and all these uh   chips companies right right right so yeah I mean  U like uh even I think I think most of the stuff   uh I learned I Lear learned through books only so  so like I would just like search for particular   books like let's say system where loog tutorial or  algorithms and then I would just read the entire   book to understand how you code this hardware  and then uh like there's another like there's an   interesting website called HDL bits uhhuh I'm not  sure who designed it but uh you can use that uh so   it's like a it's like a lead code for Hardware  uh HDL bits HDL bits HDL bits yeah Hardware   description language bits so you can use that it's  like it's similar to lead code but for very log so   anyone who wants to enter like uh Hardware design  they can use uh H bits as lead code resources like   are you able to find stack Overflow for you know  these problems you face or you just have to go   through the route of books yeah so there are some  overflow uh like websites I I forgot the name uh   but there are like uh some uh sort of blogs where  people discuss uh like all these problems cuz now   the number is growing right so now there's a  community which is growing out so uh like even   I had this community of uh I think Eda playground  uhhuh so Eda again the same thing right so they   have website called Ed playground where you could  discuss like you know let's say I say that okay I   wrote this code in vog it's not working so there  like 10 people would like try to solve it and uh   like yeah I mean if because see back back in the  day this like this industry was not that uh well   known and it didn't pay much right so people  whoever was doing like uh this work like they   were actually passionate about uh vsi that's  why they were doing it absolutely yeah like I   think there's a huge huge demand and can you share  like is there like a limit to The Innovation that   can happen in vsi and semiconductor industry like  what if like you know 3D implementation is is fin   3D chip stacking chip over chip is there a limit  to this rule um I mean it's it's it's actually   not yet uh it's it's not proven it's still uh  undergoing like it's it's still in the works so   with 3D stacking of chips there's no limit to the  amount of power you can achieve through CPUs and   gpus that's what correct correct so so I mean uh  now companies are like stacking chips over chips   and creating chiplet Technologies uh and like this  saves power and of course it improves performance   because earlier what used to happen is like when  you had a planer surface so there would be chips   interacting in Islands so you had interconnect and  just interconnect car there was a lot of latency   so now now when you stack chips over chips they  interact through this tsv or through silicon VR   I see and and that is actually very low latency  so now you'll definitely see like performance   improvements so uh that is just one field like  this is Imagine like this is just a small field   where people are innovating now there are  hundreds of such Fields like this is just   transistor technology or chip technology then  there's people working on devices right how to   improve the transistor as well then there are  people working at architecture if you look at   isca right isca there's a there's a conference  where like computer people discuss computer   architecture Innovations s gra like you know CE  met met that was also one of the biggest right so   they discuss these things yeah so so I mean people  are innovating in all aspects and since there are   like four or five Fields right that I mentioned  in every field people are innovating so combine   like uh the results you can see like if you look  at even 2 three years right two chips AP which   are 2 three years apart the performance change is  incredible in this industry of chips the delivery   time is really high or electrical engineering for  example like battery temperature you know you need   to test all these is this like Electronics work  as well or no so that is more like electrical but   you did it both right electrical and electronics  uh yeah but like uh so so the difference between   electrical and electronics is like whenever you're  working at uh anything below 5 volts uh now it's   even lower but 5 volts anything below 5 volts is  electronics okay anything above that is electrical   okay so so all these batteries like U especially  for cars they're like very high voltage they have   a lot of WTS like they store a lot of power so  that is electrical like that delivery of power is   electrical when you're like talking about uh small  chips like which go in uh the phones though or   like laptops or servers they are like Electronics  I see what do you enjoy more you measuring in both   so so I mean um I would say Electronics because  it's almost similar to surgery I would say like   it's that precise because uh I think I'm not sure  I think the radius of like uh our human here is   like in microns and we're working in nanometers  like it's like very very minute and and and and   it's like the best part is uh it's like designing  a city cuz you don't just have like X and Y so   it's not just two Dimension it's three dimensions  because now you're also going up in terms of metal   stack so so it's like a routing problem for like  a city for example right and you have to there   are like signals and powers like for example  highways and interstates and all those things   so routing those things uh and I think there's a  lot of constraint in that and it's really fun like   dealing with those constraints coming up with like  really innovative ways to solve these problems so   it's like you're creating your own world right  absolutely yeah so in this design like what is   the difference between Hardware engineering and  electronics and electrical engine Electronics   or electrical explain but where does Hardware  engineering come into this so so uh like in   electronics are other field as well for example  you have embedded systems uh interet things you   have communication uh so that is Electronics in  a whole and I would say Hardware comes within   the uh sphere of electronics but Hardware is just  anything related to I would say uh silicon right   now so uh anything that you're making like for  example if you're making chips uh that would be   considered Hardware Tech I would say yeah so  so um for example if you're making chips for   a an iPhone or a smartphone or uh some laptop or  maybe some server that's that's called Hardware   engineering now so yeah I mean I mean basically  any anytime you're making chips like in Silicon   it's called Hardware engineering so what is  your role what right okay uh so my role is uh   as I mentioned it's it's essentially converting  logic uh which is in terms of gates so there   will be a lot of logic gates you have to convert  that into uh a layout which is a which is sort   of an image and then you give this image to the  fabrication unit for example tsmc or uh Samsung   or some fabrication and they will take that image  and essentially using lithography and etching and   all those Technologies they'll just etch that  uh image on a semi so a silicon I see why you   know tsmc takes two years so it's it's not just  tsmc is like um maybe tape out would take like   3 months or 4 months right but tape out tape out  means uh essentially okay fabrication of uh this   chip uh so when like for example if I give uh my  like layout to tsmc today it'll take 4 months or 3   months for them to uh like etch the entire chip or  create the the entire chip uh and that is because   like it's a very complicated process you have like  lots of processes right uh so that's that's just   three or 4 months but majority time is taken  to design what I am talking about like layouts   so layouts take like one year oh your work is  taking the most yeah one year like I would say so   is industry there are like parts to it let's can  you break it down like stage one stage two stage   three correct okay so let's understand the step  by step absolutely and which which stage you are   okay so so it's a top down approach right so you  have the architecture which is essentially CPU   or GPU for example CPU may there's this thing  like okay uh do you want to go with uh risk or   cisk right or you want to for example you want to  have a five stage pipeline or 10 stage pipeline   right uh so architecture people will decide those  right and then they will give this architecture   to the logic design team or the RTL team the RTL  team will convert this architecture convert that   architecture specification into verilog code right  or system verog code which is essentially an HDL   now that is called logic right because that can be  synthesized into a uh sort of chain of logic gates   and once you synthesized that that's when I come  in and you say that okay uh we want to convert   this chain of logic gates into a layout and layout  made there are lot of constraints like you need to   meet uh the LVS which is basically checks so  you'll have LVS emir all those checks so you   need to meet those checks meet those constraints  and uh once you meet those constraints so taking   like meeting those constraints only takes like uh  one year so yeah so because it's like uh and it it   uses like your electrical engineering knowledge  it uses uh CS knowledge as well so using these   things you essentially finally come with a layout  which you can give to fabrication units industry   interesting like the job before you is Hardware  engineering you say uh so this entire process   is called Hardware engineering okay this okay  now so this entire process stage one 2 three is   Hardware engineering you are in a small part of  it which is like the electrical and electronics   design converting logic gates into the next stage  correct okay awesome okay let's talk about the industrys yeah I think the L of people  like uh uh everyone that I know in my   batch like most of them like I would  say 90% they got internships really yeah uh class full there so class size is like  u i mean people are like it's a there's a lot   of competition to get in this uh and once you get  in like even the other universities like you have   UT Austin as well there like I think 30 students  in the batch of EC so 30 or 40 so like uh like in   blsi so all of those like they they get like like  there's 100% conversion in terms of jobs because   it's so selective and there are very few people  and and why would you say it's a recession Pro   job okay so like I would just say that uh this  thing like requires a lot of uh knowledge one   and the problem has not been solved yet it's taken  like I think uh 50 years and it's going to take   more time to solve this problem so this is not a  problem that you can solve for example it's not a   product that uh like software you can just like uh  uh created in one month or two months or like I'm   just saying like basic product right so it takes a  lot of time and there's still lot of aspects as I   mentioned right lot of aspects which haven't been  solved yet there are problems which are like which   still exist and nobody has a solution for them so  that's why I would say example example for example   um like you have transistors so transistors now  uh we we started with like some microns and then   we came to nanometers uh AB like I think 2014  or 2017 we were stuck at like 40 nanometer then   we came to 5 75 3 2 uh 1.8 and now people are  like okay we've reached this thing people are   so people take this for granted people take okay  we will every year new uh smartphone comes we will   get a performance Improvement right but but uh  this comes at a cost like this this is because   people are like people in Hardware Tech are doing  uh like are creating and are innovating so uh like   this will continue and people demand people  demand the same thing they they demand that   each year our smartphone should improve so that's  why this is like this demand will always exist I see people yeah exactly and there's another aspect  actually very interesting aspect regarding the AI   boom I would say so as we know like we are in an  AI boom right so um like people talk about like   okay we're going to come up with new llms new  software which is good like there's a uh need   for that as well but all those things they need  compute right Nvidia is uh winning because of this   like they have the they are like uh they have the  solution right so uh even Nvidia needs people who   can actually deliver a chip so they also if you  read like they had an issue recently their chip   didn't uh black well yeah blackw is delayed by 3  months absolutely so so why because uh they had   some issue with the out so it's in Hardware  where they had they have a bottleneck right   tsmc right no not tsmc but it's within their  own cognation in Hardware so they have their   own Hardware team right yeah Hardware design  May problem right yeah there was a problem in   the hardware design and then once they got a test  chip uh I think it didn't work out well so they're   like okay we need to fix this and that's why uh  now they're going to like uh do it again like go   for tape out again so so yeah I mean uh even  there like the bottleneck is not software the   bottleneck is not architecture it's actual chip  implementation or getting the right layout out   so and you you're the one who figures out getting  a successful tape out tape out Bott fabrication you have TMC Samsung uh and I would say Intel  right so clearly there's a bigger bottleneck   uh and as compared to like design team because  design so many companies doing design to bottle   because it takes like I think it costs billions  of dollars to faor chip or create a fabrication unit that is just one that's the 90%  provider for lithium right and like   you know it's insane TMC comp yeah so that's  also so true yeah so so yeah I mean um like   uh this thing also like design companies are  very few like there a lot of design companies   there very few fabrication companies  just say tsmc so for example let's say   um if tsmc doesn't exist right tomorrow then  all these companies like Nvidia AMD Apple sub   they'll face a short shortage of chips because  everyone uses tsmc even Qualcomm switched from   uh Samsung to tsmc oh yeah because of the  because of the quality insane yeah okay now so how can people take advantage of it step  byep step by step for a CS student H okay so   CS student I mean I would say that uh first thing  that to do is like if you think that you want to   do RTL design or physical design you would need to  Lear learn like uh Digital Electronics to uh like   let's say if you want to do RTL or because  architecture easy it's like uh you just uh   like you know operating systems you know  algorithms so you just like learn more   about uh some Hardware software code design and  that'll be good enough but for uh this thing and   even compilers for example compilers is also a  nice field uh for Hardware soft code design so   uh let's say if you want to go for RTL or physical  design which is one of the more demanding uh areas   there you need like uh uh you need sort of you  need to know like basic of basics of electronics   you need to know uh like cosos mosfets transistors  all the logic like Electronics like you need dig   Digital Electronics analog Electronics uh analog  not that much but digital electronics at least   from simos till log still Boolean algebra so that  and like you already have CS students already have   that uh algorithms they have uh I would say data  science as well and uh like yeah that's those are   two basic like uh things that you need and after  these skills yeah what kind of interviews are like   asked like no so so is like they start with like  Basics so if let's say you're a fresher right you   have absolutely no knowledge of vsi or you have no  experience with vlsi then like they would expect   basics of uh electronics for example cosos they  will start with seos uh they want you to know   uh how uh like digital logic Works once you know  that so that's why I was saying that if you can   understand that and it's pretty interesting it's  like a you'll connect the dolls and you'll be like   okay this is actually making sense once you can do  that then uh I think uh they'll actually move to   algorithms they they'll ask you puzzles so example  uh for example I was like I remember when uh after   my undergrad I gave the vsi interview so I was  asked this question that uh there's a fly in a 3D   cube right and you want to uh what what distance  what is the shortest distance for the fly uh from   the I think it was one corner uh top let's say  top right corner to uh another face uh center of   the face of uh the thing so it's like okay so it  was like uh from one corner to uh the center of   the edge now the center of the edge so it's like  uh then you have to you have to know like what's   the body diagonal and and uh stuff like that so  and because you need this uh these skills to do   routing and all right so yeah yeah if you had  to restart your journey how would you do things differently I would say like if I if I knew what  I know now uh I would start like I would try for   like some high level roles for example uh so this  is like considered back end of the hardware Tech   uh front is architecture and RTL so if you start  with RTL and architecture it's very easy to move   into the back end because now you know more about  the logic for example when you're in just in back   end right i' I've always been in back end so I  was just given designs and I was told key just   uh make a layout for this I was I didn't ask like  I wasn't supposed to ask that you know why is this   happening so there was no like opportunity for  cross question at least in kayen so uh that's why   like um I wanted like if I if I could I would  have have gone into uh like a higher uh level   like front end so that I can also learn about uh  designing and then eventually move into back end   yeah so that is one thing that I would change  I see is there any exit strategy you would say   in this industry uh exit strategy as what is the  strategy you use for example I was reading Andre   who is the AI lead of Tesla right he said he left  his job at Tesla because it became very managerial think you would quit this indry um like a make  a break s of situation um it would be a very big   thing for me if like if I if I'm leaving it like I  would say probably uh if I'm not feeling that I'm   able to create the impact like if my work is not  impactful enough I would leave the industry like   like a it's like uh if I if I going to work for a  company right I would would want that I'm actually   uh saving like in in terms of power performance  or area something I'm reducing right I'm helping   them save money because if you save area it's  like so in uh semiconduct industry area is in   terms of US dollars because the more area you  save in terms of your chip the more like you'll   save in uh dollars so like I want to contribute  to that excellent and last would be what will be   the salary expectation student ENT industry what  can they expect out of the semiconductor industry   India packages and us um I would say India is  pretty good like 50 LP easy uh okay so like   fresher car I would say like you can expect 20  20 to 25 and uh like right now I would say it's   even more bloated especially like because of a  company like Nvidia Nvidia is like uh changing the   entire industry because they are paying their uh  employees so much that other companies also have   have to catch up right so I would say 2025 and  eventually like the thing is that uh as you   like uh go higher in that thing like you have more  experience right uh your salary like exponentially   increases because there are very few people uh  in the middle like with 10 years experience or 7   years experience so that like uh sort of is a very  big thing I would say like electric engineering   say Electronics say in semiconductor industry  like is it like close to software or more than   software you'll say like 150k 200k like um I I  don't know what the salaries and software are   like could you give me an example of like 120k to  150k I'll say software it's similar to that then   similar to I I I would say some in some cases it's  more than that and especially now like now to very   few companies are hiring in software right like  I know some people in CS at Jo Tech and they're   also like struggling with the full-time jobs and  they have to like settle for like something which   is non ideal I would say so but you can enter  and break in because absolutely yeah excellent   awesome yeah thank you so much it was wonderful  talking to you I learned a lot I hope this video   adds value and students gain some wisdom and can  enter this industry and break in thank you so much

When I'm not working, I'm thinking about working And when I'm working I'm working I know! It's not expected This is not my channel But I have hacked channel of Harnoor/SinghinUSA Now you'll say why I did it! I just his 2-4 videos I'll tell you everything You'll get to know such things in the video Here we go Here are many booths That is Anthropic Here is so much food guys Amazing! So, clerk has an integration with visionPro Bro its fully packed! So Hi guys, Right now We're at Stripe session We got to see the session of CEO of Invidia Jensen Huang and Arvind Srinivasan from Perplexity Getting to speak to him and see him here was Unbelievable! I haven't hacked his channel I'm making a video. I got a chance and I'm here at Stripe sessions conference where I met Harnoor. We met each other and felt very good. My name is harry, You must have seen me on Code with harry channel. I'm a software developer and I make videos on youtube One of the most indepth videos I've ever seen Let's start firstly about AI Jensen Huang said that the people and companies who won't use AI They'll have almost 5-10x less growth. Acc to you, How much % of your job has been taken by AI? And how much you think it's gonna continue Firstly I'm thankful that Harnoor invited me on his channel and that intro was just a joke Don't cut 50rs for overacting but coming to the point what Harnoor asked that will AI eat your job? If you've seen me before then I always say no and what we heard now from Jansen Huang and he told things just like Harnoor told you where he said that you'll not be replaced by AI but There are two big innovations in AI, No.1 is ChatGPT No.2 Llama 3 He just said that it got breakthrough from Llama 2 only. Because of Llama 2 and 3, Generative AI has reached massive no. of people. So you tell me, what'll be benefit from Llama 2 and 3? I'll tell you, See I'll just tell you Jansen words He said that ChatGPT reached to all people To marketers and software developers Almost to everyone But Llama 2 did a new thing Those people who were not using chatGPT Maybe they didn't want their data to be stolen Even sometimes I used to think that I am using company's data So they used to say that don't put in ChatGPT What Llama did was, They did it open source They said that Before it was, ChatGPT on server of open AI You're sending request from here and all data is going to open AI. Open AI knows what you're doing But what will happen with Llama 2 is Something like chatGPT running on your server It was powerful enough Llama 3 has better results than even GPT3.5 And it is offline in that And for copilot people used to pay $10/month They beat that also Now it is free You also made Yes I have Yes, I have watched it It was very nice Talking about Llama 3 It changed industry because because before employees of many companies used to feel jealous that this employee is allowed to use chatGPT but us We had security code but we couldn't put But with Llama 3, A privacy layer came It got offline No copilot needed Don't have to pay $10/month to companies. And that just changed the game for developers. Now it is so much accesible to developers. Correct, Even Jansen said this thing Jansen also said it, I completely agree And it got very smooth with coming of Llama 3 and with open source models. Now there's pressure even on open AI that they release their open source model Like google pay is doing with open source model. So, this wave of open source models That was started by facebook with Llama 2 and Llama 3 And their biggest competition is that who'll buy more GPU of Invidia Introduction was very good, they talked about their GU H100. Meta CEO is taking more Elon Musk is taking more Jansen Huang spoke about future of AGI Artificial general intelligence. So first of all, if we want to define You define first, How you'll say What is AGI? And I want to add it because AGI is getting better everyday A said definition of AGI means I mean, people have defined I'll tell you what Jensen Huang said We both heard the talk some time back In that they said that define a particular problem that AI will do AI will definitely do it. If not today then definitely in next 5 years. It's not like him. We can joke as well We can also tell that How's San Francisco He can tell you that What you have to do to come in US I can tell you what's in New Delhi I mean, he can also tell but You've to give particular problem to AI And train on that problem and AI will do it That's what they said You tell what's your definition of AGI AI will be capable of doing it. But on this thing, I'll say that That atleast for next 5-7 years which I'm saying that is valid That's what I thnk Otherwise, what someone will do in one month we don't know Alright That's what it is Basically AGI is, how fast our kinda intelligence can reach to it General thinks the same way we think But Jansen Huang said If you define that If you can think like an english teacher That chatGPT can also do So, by saying that I got so shocked that I also got shocked to hear that When they made us realize this thing If you get to listen that talk then must listen The way he said The way he explained that AGI didn't came, that all are saying But if you define a particular problem and after that you define AGI according to that Like, now he said about english speaking that you want to learn english speaking ChatGPT will teach you If chatGP is also less You train another model and then see the capabilities Today we talk about 7 billion parameter Those 7 billion parameters are handling Even if you talk about chatGPT knows coding, cooking knows where to wander in san francisko Also knows what's in New delhi It also knows what's in my city and his city. Just try and train the 7 billion model in a particular problem You'll be shocked Exactly! that Which model is better? Like he told me in the talk today that The whole game changes For example: If you have knowledge We train its data whose accuracy is 99%. Train data of my knowledge which is 98%. So, if you combine both is not better. Keep both separately The reason he said that was that if you are training english model Do it separate separate for spanish, hindi and punjabi. I want to say is, if two people have different knowledge They model gets trained and there'll be lots of arguments. So implement them parallely and use them separately they should use Llama as well chatGPT also There is meta also. So if someone wants to produce then use all four I use perplexity also. Now I'll add a point on this If you are doing any particular work We use 90% chatGPT for coding only Exactly! So, I know which AI I want to use Like when I use Llama I made a video on that as well I use code Llama in that because I have tested it I have tested myself I'd say that you test it for your own use case that you get better results in Llama or which model You're getting from chatGPT, Llama3 or Llama 4 There are many different models So, from which you're getting and use it according to that What's performing best for your use case Use that model Exactly! You have to do multiple use for best accuracy that if two people are trained with different knowledge Output of both can be completely different Both can have complete different output because we both have different experience which Jansen Huang spoke about I wish you having all the pains in life. Let said one line, let me recall it that I will torture you to excellence Absolutely true passion is not something that your everyday goes in fun. He said that I want you to feel the torture to excellence. So you also feel that you've also made a unicorn He said that So later in life you see yourself doing something good. Exactly That's how he said Had lots of goosebumbs on it On this, tell the students as they are choosing their passion now There are lots of things I'll tell you on this I believe that if you're in college Alright People talk many things People tell to start business or startups, Many things are going in market I'm like, you see your success first Everyone have their next level It can be next level for someone For someone, next level can be Whatever is your enxt level If you're in college then it might be In whichever college you're If you're in IIT You know google and microsoft are coming And if you know your CGPA is capable if they're asking for DSA. If they start asking from tomorrow There only you'll get the experience. There only you'll get to know many things This is how it works I'm not saying only job. whichever is your next level. You reach that next level. Like if you know with web development, you may get internships This is what I'll see for now Don't think of too far Don't think of making a billion dollar company I've seen small kids that we want to make billion dollar company. Atleast pass semester's exam first Rightly said because Shouldn't decide present by thinking of future Now there are jobs of web development Currently most jobs are of web developmet and then data science. Prepare for them No one knwos what's gonna happen in future See job portal and wherever are the jobs Prepare for that I think he's secretely promoting surf excel. He said it 2-3 times. What you think, Before you see any channel of DSA That was very booming chatGPT has killed that What you think how much value DSA plays in your life? See, if I tell you truth There's been very less role of DSA in my journey. That doesn't means people shouldn't do DSA. I think people should do DSA. People do it very aggresively It also has many variations If you're sitting to see If you'll just see DSA codes then you'll miss many codes. like we were talking about Llama 2. YOu don't understand why Llama 2 is important If you'll give whole time to DSA when you'll do the rest You must go little into web development also Atleast you should know how websites work people don't even know about server You must also know You don't know client server And you're saying I know all questions We don't need to become a machine Because we have machine ChatGPT You're right that DSA is only needed to a limit I've 4 years of experience in software engineering I have not used link list Neither I made arrays from scratch Used all DSA concepts for understanding only Never had to use from scratch Right! If I ever did then I did for video only. that web development has got very saturated. You made video on this On that some people say that like how you'll enter into tech industry Acc to me, if you see what AI can do You'll decide on basis of AI capabilities then you won't be able to do anything So if you'll think this then you'll never be able to grow I'll say don't think so much I mean, what's visible now What's visible that's what I am saying He's also saying what he knows No one knows what will happen after 10 years Exactly! We don't know what will happen in 10 years No one knew chatGPT will come We're saying all acc. to our understanding only If I tell you about my understanding Now AI lacks creativity I feel that I mean there's not much creativity Like the way we vlog We did vlogging and I show you around like here is this and that with jokes Take this video as example Can AI make this video? With our insights We are telling our experience Maybe AI can't generate There'll always be something which AI will lack after that add your value There's something you need to do in life. If you'll think that AI will do it and I can't then Had a lot of fun Thank you so much Harry, Glad to talk to you Let's wander and do something 1-2 days But we'll say bye to audience Let it be AI or anything Didn't knew when the one hour finished
