Friends, in India, a student can go to a med school right after their 12th grade. But in USA you have to do Pre Med for four years in order to go to a med school So that's why today I decided to challenge pre med students in Johns Hopkins University with our most difficult medical entrance exam called NEET. And the rules were pretty simple. 3 questions in 3 minutes. From physics, chemistry or Biology. So this is an exam from our Indian Medical entrance exam. So we are given 180 questions- around 200 questions to be done in 180 minutes. And what's your favourite subject by the way? - Probably Chemistry. - So this has Physics, Chemistry, Botany and Zoology. By the way, would you like to introduce yourself? Oh, I am Crystal and I am a chem major a pre med. I will hopefully go to Med School. Oh, so it's just pre med, right? So you do 4 years pre med and then 4 years med school, right? How do you feel about the paper so far? I am a first year med student so I haven't learned a lot of it. So it's just scary looking through this. What did you say the topics are? The topics are Chemistry, Physics, Botany and Zoology. 2 categories of Biology. So we are supposed to do this in our 12th grade because we don't have pre med. So this is our like- High school stuff. Botany? Yeah, I mean, you can just Botany, I think. That could be... Where is the Botany section? Botany is in the end. I could do this. 100%. I could do this! That's Physics row, right? Yeah, I can see that! In one minute you can? - You sure? - Oh! In one minute? Is she allowed to help me or not? No! No.. That was really quick! In one minute! Yeah, that's quick. Okay. Okay, so I got that wrong. 123. Okay.. Never mind. 147. Oh! never mind. You will still win 20 dollars! I will do it right after you are done! What's your name and what's your major? My name is Marwa and I am also a chem major and a math major as well. Awesome. And after your pre med what are your plans? Like you wanna do.. go for..? Med school hopefully. Oh nice. So you got all three? Awesome. Let's check the answer sheet. 2. That's right. 97... Number 2. That's right as well! Oh my God! Drum Roll! 3rd Question! 145.. It's 2. OHHH! - Sorry. - So close! You still won 20 dollars for participating. Don't worry. Is pre med hard or it's easy like.. how do you feel about pre med so far? We just started our classes. This is our first year.. So... So I am taking like Chem 1 and 2, Physics 1, Bio 1 So it's like all the basic linkage of classes. Nice. What are your plans after pre med? It's the same thing. Like.. probably go to med school and hopefully be a surgeon I am looking to either neuroscience or cardiology. I think most popular is internal medicine right? Yeah. I think it's mainly internal medicine because of the family and work balance. The work life balance. Nice talking to you. Thank you so much for your time! Would you like to introduce yourself first? Yeah! Okay. So I am Kaitlyn. And... and we currently go to Johns Hopkins University in Undergrad I am studying biophysics right now. Awesome! So what would you be pursuing after pre med? I don't know! That's a great question! Yeah, I am not really sure what I wanna do yet. Whether it's the actual going into medical school or... How about you? I am Isioma and I am also at Hopkins and I am studying medicine science and humanities I wanna be a PA surgeon but I don't.. - Nice! - yeah. And.. What about you? Hi! I am Soliana.

So what are your favourite subjects among these? What's my favourite? I like probably Physics and... Bro! I need to know how to do this!! 32. Is that 4? - That's right! 24. Is that one?
