in the last few months something strange is happening in tech industry for international students I would say less than 15% nobody has to program and that the programming language it's human seniors senior software Engineers are in a demand if you follow tldr Bloomberg Wall Street Journal any Tech news you will only see news about AI you know maybe software engineering doesn't exist anymore what is happening what is wrong with tech industry right now in the US and all over the world let's talk about in this video so hi everyone I hard currently working as a software engineer at Microsoft and I have been so close to Silicon Val Engineers AI Engineers so four important things in this video update on the layoffs broken senior only Tech market update from the FDA and interest rate departments about the new hiring process and last what tech industry wants in 2024 number one layoffs so this is a story about h&v a couple in Bay Area who they were having a really good life both for making almost 200k plus salary having a great time and suddenly one of the employee of a big tech company not a small startup they get an email I was so scared that I was going to have like a panic attack an urgent email invite from a hiring manager yeah come immediately we need to talk about it the person is very nervous and that person is called to the hiring manager's cabin without giving time to pick up the computer no no time at all nothing but the person goes to hiring manager's desk he's given a notice K you are laid off and you should leave right now and exit the building no time given to pick up stuff from the desk he had the only photo of his mother on the desk and and suddenly kicked out of the desk also Google when they laid off employees the next day they open their laptop and they see that oh they don't have access to their computer no time given to take out the personal data from their computer and layoffs are so toxic sometimes that this is done so that when a person is going back to their desk they don't like you know use abusive language and they don't disturb the productivity of rest of the employees so that's why it is done as silently as possible which makes it really really toxic and when you leave that employer you feel like you know you have done a crime there's a bunch of research that finds that layoffs not surprisingly can lead to all kinds of bad things 20% decline in lifetime earnings increased risk of divorce cardiovascular disease depression even suicide you're no less than a criminal in tech industry when you're laid off but the harsh truth is this is part of American culture more than 40% of employees will get laid off at some point of time and this has been happening from the last 60 70 years as per the data now number two why layoffs are hard right now even in this third quarter so third quarter in the US has started since 1st July there were layoffs from Microsoft there were layoffs from many big tech companies the moment this quarter began so why layoffs are hot so much right now in 2024 is it AI is it something else so number one is non AI reason which was the movement done by Elon Musk so Elon Musk led the team of Twitter there were eight 1,000 employees in Twitter and laid off 70% of the workforce now there are only 2,000 people now if you look at Twitter app many people say it is better than before the application is light lightweight it is much faster than before and it works pretty seamlessly and it did not need seems like yeah 8,000 employees were not needed with 2,000 employees it is enough so as per Josh as well I watched his video he very well said that there is definitely area in tech industry when they hire more people they make their investors happy yeah we are hiring more people we are growing and we will make more Revenue we'll bring more Revenue as well so hiring more people is a sign that your company is doing well that's why companies Keep On hiring and the engineers sometimes for example at Snapchat they had a uiux engineering team of 400 people and Snapchat maybe doesn't need 400 people working on buttons UI they can just like Twitter they can maybe work productively with maybe 5 10 20 ux designers so there is definitely some hyper skills hyper category of Engineers which are not needed they are basic doing basic stuff they're just over hired even now that are being released slowly just to keep investors happy and just to show Wall Street that next quarter will be highly generating Revenue quarter so it's all about keeping the investors happy now next category of AI layoffs so it is true that AI has caused some sort of layoffs for example Shopify CEO there was a leak from Shopify CEO's message that the the biggest reason of layoffs has relationship with AI and I discussed with you know the AI expert from Silicon Valley from the professor Dr Ahmed banfa and he also agreed as well that AI will cause more layoffs but at the same time currently even now the more layoffs are customer engineering layoff for engineer layoffs but not experienced Engineers who are getting laid off who know gcp as well Azure as well aw as well no those are extremely rare happening in tech industry so let me give you an example uh currently when I was working at NCR so in NCR we use two Cloud platforms when I I was working there they use gcp as well they use you know AWS as well so if an engineer already knows those two cloud cloud platforms and they are already you know above a common engineer who knows these two Cloud platforms they're never going to get laid off but if there's an engineer who just knows AWS and is not able to you know go above and beyond responsibilities though W sh can be laid off so that's why I think there is definitely huge demand in Cloud I want to tell you AWS Amazon just you will be shocked this is the biggest AI news Amazon is going to use nuclear energy for their AI data centers directly from the nuclear plant this is this has never happened before Mark Z think before we hit that you're going to run into energy constraints said this in this in his podcast that biggest bottleneck biggest barrier to entry for AI is not the data it's not not the gpus it's not the hardware it is energy it is so true it is coming out to be true now that Amazon needs so much more energy for AI power data centers that they are going to pull out energy from nuclear power directly they're going to use nuclear energy and that shows how much demand after AI is in cloudbased learning you know these distributed system even the podcast I did with you know AI engineer in February we talked about that more demand is for software Engineers with distributed system knowledge and it is still so so true so that's why I am so glad to partner with code Cloud which allows you to you know use Amazon AWS gcp Plus Azure learn all those three together with one subscription and they don't like you know just give you tutorials they tell you go sign in to gcp experiment experiment with AKs clusters all the cloud services you need to know to be valuable for these AI companies to be an AI engineer so I love code cloud and you can go check out and get the specialty with my link in description below so how many people you think are actually getting job percentage wise uh percentage wise like it's below 10% now number three continuing with job market still International students are struggling to get a job I went to Stony Brook University I went to NYU more than 60% of international students haven't gotten a job yet it is so shocking more than 60% they will either do there another Masters either go back to India or maybe just do volunteering as a research assistant at the University or maybe do a PhD so they're trying all the options as possible so that they don't have to go back home and it is one of the worst time for international students someone can imagine now let me tell you the reason for that so recently Federal Trade Administration they released the news that let's say an engineer works for AWS Amazon you know they work for their Cloud platform now they want to go to their competitor like Amazon's competitor is Walmart or aw's competitor is Google Cloud platform now they want to go they can go easily that is not a problem anymore and these laws were you know uh earlier restricting employees to go to competitors now they can easily go unless you make above 150k or you are a senior engineer so if they are senior they cannot go if they are not senior they can go if they make less than 150k they can go if they make more than 150k they have those anti-competitive rules non-compete agreement there that prevents them to go to competitor so because of that this Market is more senior so let's say if a senior engineer comes to AWS they will be less like likely to go to gcp less likely go to Walmart less likely to go to competitors so this Market has become a senior only broken market now how to you know come out of this broken senior market how to be an engineer who can easily be hired so I you know with my 3 years plus of experience I apply I get a you know position easily because I am in that senior category but someone who is starting new in the US job market how can they break this barrier number one is they can ask their re research assistant for example when I was working in my University as a research assistant I asked my professor yeah can I just use the title senior senior research assistant they were like sure so just you know ask wherever you're working whether it's as a student if it's a teaching assistant you can just put Senior in it and ask the ask the employer can I put Senior in my title and you can cut that non senior market from your resume and be senior ready in in this you know senior is a is a buzz word in in the valley right now Whoever has like software engineer 2 or senior this these are just numbers if you can somehow put in your resume you break the site since you recruit a lot what are the most high paid jobs you see in the valley is it AI software engineer cyber security what are the ones you see well when we look at the websites with seller raes we can see that um senior seniors senior software Engineers are in a demand because for for example last week one of my friends got an offer for 800k wow where where was it this um it was uh Facebook so again data scientists machine learning Engineers AI specialist all seniors are always in demand so don't please don't be afraid of losing that job then AI cannot substitute those jobs number two is everyone is using AI generated rums these days everyone have the buzzword because yeah there are so many AI tools like teal Ai and all that I don't you know use that because at the end of the day up directly chat GPT use you can use directly chat GPT because at the end of the day all these AI tools are using some sort of llm like chat GPT and using some sort of prompt why use the third party and pay for it if Chad GPT Gemini and Claud are free give a prompt and just give the best prompt look for the best prompt and get all the buzz words for senior market this should be the prompt tell me if I am a senior versus now what will the buzz worth I have to add to my resume to be senior engineer use chat GP to be in your favor because these prompts no one knows they just ask the chat GPT yeah improve my resume no you have to improve your resume by comparing it with senior resume you need to know about it and chat GPT and all these llms are already trained with that data so these two strategies can help you come out of that senior only broken market and and number four is this job market is different currently genzies have chosen more white collar jobs as compared to older generation of Millennials because of that there is shortage in construction job market there is increase of $28,000 per year salary of any construction engineer or construction people that is so amazing because people are so hyped up about tech industry more people are choosing this major computer science and supply has increased so much and demand is kind of similar as before so that's why it is very important to stand out and for standing out I tell you number one the biggest advice I've given these days is don't just blindly email any hiring manager go to your browser look for all the conferences all the tech events where hiring was happening now the recruiters which were already hiring in those events they're still hiring now probably and email those recruiters who want to hire people as compared to just blindly emailing all the recruiters on LinkedIn no you need to find the right place right time so is you need to know which recruiters are hiring and apply only to those as compared to random recruiters and this can be only found if you just go and scrape the data of all the active events for example on Luma doai that's one of the favorite website I use on Luma you can see all the Bay Area events and see who are coming and this is this is like you know these are the recruiters or these were the people who were there to make awareness about the company and they definitely want Engineers so apply to those companies with these names of recruiters and the chance that be higher to hear back and last thing I you know I tell people you have to have something related to the hype currently Cloud engineering is at the biggest hype as you can imagine because Distribution Systems and this knowledge is highly demand because of AI AKs kubernetes and you know these uh these Services which deploy these llms on different different data centers and this can be okay and uh and U this distributed system just kubernetes you know distributed system like kubernetes Docker all of these skills connected with cloud computing can help you the most so you can go to Cod cloud and learn those Azure AWS as well as gcp on the same platform immediately so that'll be it go to cloudcloud don't forget to check out code cloud in description below and thank you so much for watching
