day so recording videos uh having fun building different systems that's what I do now primary focus is on Java but also explored blockchain and now exploring going to explore AI uh and thanks for the motivation before this video I mean soon I'll be focusing on AI as well I stay in Bangalore so mostly we be having some questions on Bangalore as well awesome so first of all let's start with the Technologies which are getting outdated for example us that you know there was a hype of Open Source Big Data tools like spark like Hadoop they are outdated now because cloud is the future so things are changing really fast and uh I mean maybe Hado might be relevant for some companies but cloud is the biggest future like companies came like data brick Snowflake and right people are moving their data to these companies and Hardware is reaching data centers as compared to normal person doesn't need to create create a room full of of gpus room full of hard drives ssds deoy and it's much more convenient so can you can you share in in terms of your T stack out is it spring boot next which is going to get outdated what are the things getting outdated now in fact uh see there are things which actually get outdated and then there are things where people say it will get outed soon uh in fact in 2006 or 7 when I started learning Java and people were saying Java is getting outdated from 2007 2007 it's been 20 17 years now 18 years Java is still there and springboard is still in the market uh but yeah but there are certain Technologies which are changing very fast in terms of cloud you mentioned uh I remember 2014 uh I saw an ad in a newspaper a company was hiring a Hado developer and they were paying they ready to pay 4 KS package wow I was like I want to learn Hadoop now so why time and I was like okay first I will complete Java series I will learn had I will make Hado series because it's trending so much but you have to also understand as a company perspective in fact discuss you mentioned about companies focus on those things which are making profit go with J they can easily maintain it and uh the talent the resource people they can be example let's say if you are working on some project and then suddenly you you feel that I want to leave this job go go somewhere else they can't depend on techologies which you use they want to make it standard to manage they Outsourcing it in fact that's why we have thiss cultureel and it was magic at one point in fact I remember 20178 when I was exploring uh Amazon uh code star so Amazon also has their own pipeline uh the way we have GitHub they have code commit which is just got uh uh they have discontinued code commit three days back uh they also have the they have the entire Pipeline and for for me it was a magic I'm writing a code in Java I'm just saying saying sa save and commit in this machine automatically I can see the build in the server for a company it becomes very easy to manage people it becomes very easy to manage the softwares now coming back coming back to uh the Java Java and stuff uh 2010 was a boom period where Java was very famous again people were talking about it will get outdated but also when I saw the market Java was everywhere and then suddenly AI boom started everyone's like okay now we have to work on AI and the easiest language to work in AI is uh python so people like okay so we have to Learn Python then learn AI on the other hand uh when you got web development easiest way to build application now is Javascript you know those those were golden days where we used to learn different technology for different stack or different layers for front end learn HTML C JavaScript for the middle we you can learn c.net or Java or PHP for the backend database technology also have to master and then JavaScript people like no you know we should we know one language we want to do everything in that language I want to do frontend we got react I wanted to to back end we got nodejs expressjs we got we wanted to go uh database also in JavaScript so we got Json formats now mongodb so everything is Javascript now when you say things are outdated lot of people also say that angular is outdated not exactly uh the thing is they have different segments in the market we got startups preferring to work with react python because it's easier to find people who can work on that and startups they have the ideas right they have they want to implement that in a in a week so they will prefer a language where people know about the language and also it is easy to build on the other hand if you talk about the Enterprise Market they go with some stable stuff they don't have this idea okay today we got the idea tomorrow we'll Implement they go with a chain of

okay today we got the idea tomorrow we'll Implement they go with a chain of process someone will have the initiate someone will take the initiation then someone will uh plan it some some other team will execute it and then they look for Technologies which are stable which will go for a long time and that's why they prefer stable languages like okay don't bash me on this but they prefer NET Framework they prefer Java in that stack it's not like they're not using node but then preferable is still Java and uh uh net Java you can also say cotlin because it is easier to work with cotlin than Java so yeah that's how the things are nothing is getting audited is just that different company have different approach to work with totally agree same with Cloud so for for example biggest preference for companies is AWS because let's say they have a they're already using AWS and most people know AWS because AWS doing the the most amount of conferences AWS is working so good on marketing they have the most number of services so it is easier to hire an AWS Cloud developer as compared to Azure as compared to gcp so that's why the highest number of profit is also number Al also made by AWS then Azure then Cloud so it's becoming you know it's becoming a bubble and it's expanding and Google and Azure are using other ways to compete so like whatever disadvantage advantage that is the strategy they use it's same like uh same like Advantage '90s if you know IBM was the biggest software company when it started 90s May and then uh they used to use database with nodes so for example uh let's say let say you have an account number let's say this is a bank this is account number it's a node and it will have a branch for name her Na and this is how databases used to work and SQL got invented and Oracle became the first company to implement IBM was slow so disadvantage orle Advantage now it's the bigger company bigger company in software now so I think that's how the cycle plays now in with IBM I remember IBM always starts something but they're not fast enough to move as I mentioned uh in fact Watson the AI platform for IBM they were like they're talking about Watson every everywhere but then suddenly other companies are coming up and they are taking away the market yeah so whatever some companies disadvantage you can start a company there and leaded right yeah now my big question is I think in our education system in Java the biggest challenge is Java is getting updated every year but coursework is not I go to colleges in Us in India both have have problem they still learning Java 6 7 8 we have Java 22 now true like Java I was using the last J version 18 so do you think is that okay what is lacking in Java education now uh I mean not just Java it's with most of the Technologies now in fact when I was doing my degree we Al we were also outdated then when I came to the market then I understood okay that was outdated there is something you have to learn it all depends upon the students now in fact when I go to different colleges I saw few colleges are taking effort so few colleges are autonomous so they have their own uh curriculum so they are trying to implement it example let's say uh the university says we have to teach Java 7 this colleges go for Java 11 or Java let's say 14 Max the problem is colleges cannot upgrade every year they can't actually they don't have this capacity of catching away technology in fact as an independent trainer I can't catch up with the Technologies like everywhere we are going so I'm focusing on blockchain now ai is booming if I go on AI something else will boom even I can't catch up so College are doing their best or maybe they're not even doing anything it depends upon it comes down to students now they have to understand this college is only for environment college is for you to go for a structure education but apart from it you have to also learn things which are happening in the market and don't just learn everyone talks about tutorial hell YouTube is one uh you go to YouTube you follow", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 5741, "end_char_idx": 10692, "text_template":

industry so that students will know what to work on so they will go home they will we have the chat GP now we got Google so we have to motivate student to learn don't teach them motivate them that's very important and same I think they should come to Bangalore and go to Luma meetup.com cerebral Valley all of these meetups some are remote some are in person attend those and learn from industry people what is happen and then then they get more motivated I think in person motivation is 10x more true true now you started with a YouTube channel you start with the journey to teach people can you can you share what people already don't know so how did you start from mumbai's chw what were the challenges of building this YouTube channel and how you convert it to a startup so 2012 you graduated uh yeah in fact when I was doing my msse uh 2011 uhhuh so at that point I was responsible so in fact we had the system in our College we can train our Juniors so I was doing Masters we were responsible to train the Juniors uh and then at one time I can't talk about the college because they would feel bad but there's a problem that I I wanted to teach something to the students but then I I was stopped then I felt K as a trainer if I love teaching I should be able to teach to everyone and then I went home I recorded my first video because at that time YouTube was not it was more for c videos I can say education was not the main Moto of YouTube to views I was demotivated or plus record is a big challenge now at least I have a good Studio I got a camera at that point recording video in that one room where you have a one bed T so you have to stop them I can record the video so I was finding it challenging supp4 uh my wife when she was my girlfriend we were discussing about what else we can do uh apart from so we wanted to build a product look at the Indian tech Market we were hardly having good trainers I can teach so I will start uploading videos we were thinking about different names example one of the name which came out is nain skills but then I don't want my name with the channel based on company I can't sell my name so we wanted to go for some unique names so Tesco came into picture or Fe we started uploading videos what does Tesco mean Tesco is a telu word which means get to know so I'm T I don't speak telu much but then I wanted to go for my mother tongue so is get to know then I started uploading videos again crowd but I was happy com after six months of uploading videos I got a comment because of this video I got the job I was like okay I'm not getting money from YouTube but at least I'm helping people so that was my first motivation and slowly stud I got I got messages from different countries uh one of my initial subscriber I think shabir is was his name uh he used to message me on LinkedIn or different platforms uh I watched your videos uh you know I've learned a lot from them but I I'm confused with this topic I was like okay I got the new content so I started uploading videos on those things which he was he wanted to learn he wanted to pay me but then I thought not a good time to pay now let's see later but that's how we started I started uploading videos 2016 came and then uh you mentioned about cotlin uh Google announced that they are making apart from java they can also use cotlin is the official language for Android it was 9:00 a.m. I got to know and I thought now people will come to learn cotlin so 11:00 a.m. we recorded the video by round two we uploaded our first video wow in a week I uploaded the entire series I was like channel was here it went there 2018 again AI hype hype was there uh people wanted to Learn Python in fact I went live on YouTube and I was talking about something and people like teach python teach python I was like I'm not into python I love Java they're like no I we want to Learn Python I thought let me try how difficult it", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx":

python I was like I'm not into python I love Java they're like no I we want to Learn Python I thought let me try how difficult it can be to learn a new language so I learned python in one week I started uploading video but then you mentioned right before the uh before this video that do don't you get bored by making the content I was like actually I get bored so I wanted to do something different in Python so what I did is I used lot of VFX not exactly the high level VFX but then using green screen at that point it was new 2018 was lot of people were not using green screen for the videos I used green screen animations on the screen and one video was taking one day to edit and I recorded around 100 videos so the entire 6 months I was making python videos and that was fun it took time but it was fun and channel was here after Cartland two years python took it somewhere else and then I came to know that people want to learn it's just that when they want to learn something they want to I me it's it's our job to make it interesting right how do you keep them engaged because nowadays because of Instagram and all those tools we don't have patience we want to see things in 5 seconds if you don't like it swipe how do we make it interesting for a tutorial where you're talking about let's say doing a login form using python how do you make it motivating so that's the thing I was trying to do uh then uh at one point I wanted to explore different Technologies I had a team because initially yesterday I was doing my uh content creation recording editing I was doing by myself at one point I thought I need people so I started hiring people for editing then for Content creation for managing the company and uh supporting the Audi because we have we done different courses on on on our platform so we wanted to provide support to them so in that case the company grew up not the initial plan I don't I'm not a people person where I can manage people I can I can actually but I realized when I started managing people I can't work on my own things because making a video creating content is a creativity work and if you are into creative work you you want people to leave you alone and if you get a call we have to talk we have to discuss about this things you get distracted so now I try to avoid it but again if you run a company you don't you don't have a choice so yeah balancing life between employees YouTube and family so lot of uh people in tech industry talk about quitting their job for content creation for the startup in Bangalore so can you share what point of time you thought of quitting your job was it when YouTube Revenue went same level or above it above your full-time job okay good question because again the same year 2016 uh before CTL so what happened is I was uh doing uh trainings I was doing a lot of trainings in different companies I left my software job because I I used to love teaching and I got to know that training gives me more money than in software development and I got into training I was making good amount of money in 2016 and then when I saw the YouTube stats it was looking good so I was rning 10% of what I I was making as a a corporate trainer uh and then I thought okay this is good but then when I looked at my YouTube videos I was uploading videos once in a week and then I used to you I used to look at the comments they saying waiting for the next video I want to learn this topic I was not able to manage making videos and doing corporate trainings then I the day I I I thought okay what if I can make one video or two videos per day can I survive with the revenue from YouTube I thought I can't but I do have a saving so I switched I stopped doing any all the trainings in fact I was doing uh seven to eight trainings per year came down to one training per year and then currently I'm also doing training one one training per year just to be in the market just to go there just to meet people uh I stopped doing training I was only focusing on you for two years I was surviving with one/ tenth of the revenue of what used to make so my expense was almost above than what I was getting almost 10 times yeah so you took a risk right but what what is Corporate Training can you explain uh so the thing which I do on YouTube I", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 14797, "end_char_idx": 19478,

Training can you explain uh so the thing which I do on YouTube I used to do in corporate so example when companies hire different candidates and they have a project on Java they have a project on which is springboard or python so I go there to teach them different Technologies so it's more of a consulting job where you have to also talk about the curriculum what so some companies they have the reded curriculum this is what you have to teach some companies they say we have this project we have this candidates you have to take them from here to there you decide what you want to teach but just make them ready so it was fun yeah I've seen even in big companies Amazon Microsoft meta uh all the we big companies uh even even like you know Google has their learning platform where they teach their own employees because they use their own tools so they do online sessions online recordings so it's something similar right kind of similar yeah similar okay now what are the real challenges of running a startup in Bangalore I can tell you the real challenges of San Francisco and San Jose is they call it man Jose they they they struggle with finding girls in the city this just people talk about it's just Tech and less job market for people who don't want jobs in Tech so is B Bangalore you think similar is it like Mangalore or Bangalore you can say Mangalore because in fact in Tech in general when you talk about tech uh the male ratio is much higher than female ratio uh there are several reasons to it but then we have to change it we have to motivate uh women in Tech and most of the companies are doing that that's a good initiative they are taking uh apart from that one of the challenges is the cost in Bangalore it's much higher in fact I was born by in Mumbai to and people say that Mumbai is very costly compar if you talk about Indian cities they used to think Mumbai is the costliest one then we shifted to Bangalore and now the things are changing I am finding Bangalore is much costlier than Mumbai uh that's one that's one issue uh another issue is lot of tech people are there in Bangalore that's a good thing for me because when I go out when I used to go in go out in Mumbai let's say there's a chance that at least one person will recognize me in Bangalore it's more so I know when if I go to a market at least one person will be there who will say I've seen you somewhere is it the same guy I'm not sure maybe I look different in real life compared to YouTube uh so those are the good things but also challenge because we have lot of tech people and since we have lot of tech people that there's lot of money in Bangalore since there a lot of money in Bangalore the cost is going up but running a startup is always difficult doesn't matter the city is managing people is one of the biggest thing of especially finding good talent and okay there are two things one Talent is important but also their mindset some people are talented but they don't don't want to work much and there are people who are not that talented but they give their heart out to work on your project so I prefer the person I'm second category it's okay when if you're not that good with Talent or the technology you should be excited to work it's like the same principle like high Fast Fire fast like you know cicon Valley has the same it's very very fast goinging okay and in terms of the cost of course Mumbai I when I travel in Mumbai and travel in Bangalore I feel the difference challenge which tech industry people talk about is that Apartments like maybe it's very expensive

difference challenge which tech industry people talk about is that Apartments like maybe it's very expensive 20 30,000 rupees they will take 6 months of security deposit of your rent and or in the same city people with 3 lakh rupees package a year and one CR rupees with three four years of experience are able to cope up and what are the challenges when there is that much pay differences in the same city in fact we had the same discussion before moving to Bangalore the good thing is we are living outside Bangalore so the cost is not that high compared to city and I've seen lot of employees they share the rooms so example they share one or two BK Max so difficult to survive withs in Bangalore but look manage there now last what is the future of telescope when is since it is a startup what are what students can expect in the next few years so there are two things which we are doing now one uh I have spent lot of time teaching lot of time spending on YouTube I've observed one thing when you talk about trainers I have seen all amazing trainers in the world because I'm I'm a corporate trainer I meet them and when they go into classroom in 5 10 minutes the students are like wow but the same person when they come in front of camera they struggle because they don't know how to teach to a camera so one of my aim in next few years is teaching how to teach or sharing my experience how I came came from corporate world to the camera world uh next we are planning to launch some more products enough of teaching more of uh products to help students in terms of uh now we have all this platform right lead code and all the stuff apart from it I want to focus on some product where they can learn building projects not just building small applications big projects working in a team because when you join a company you have to work in a team and what they don't learn Now is working in a team uh even if you do a course you're learning it alone you're not you're not going to work alone in a company so we want to build that system where at the start itself they can they will learn how to work in a team how to work work on a big project and what are the issues they can find in the industry to solve it and you get a bootstrap all the way everything is Bo strap so we there's a point when we thinking about uh getting funding we we might get funding but the problem is once you get funding investors have lot of say to what you should do and I'm the not kind of person who can go with the invest investor way I have my own plans and we are making enough money so that we can implement it awesome and what would be the final advice for students because AB what people have told me that AB currently in Bangalore 80% jobs are software which are booving much more poaching happening LinkedIn software it is the boom of software era in Bangalore and now slowly it's 20% AI it's going to move more into AI so what advice you would give to students so that they can catch up okay one thing very important uh as I mentioned before don't just learn things implement it it's very important right so it doesn't matter how much you learn it's first thing you have to implement stuff go with the trending one uh example AI is there now focus on AI maybe you don't want to master not everyone is meant for AI uh you can learn AI in two ways one actually learning Ai and second is how to use AI uh what is booming more is how do we use AI to implement our own stuff nowadays uh but very important Implement and learn new things also go to different events we were discussing about different events as you mentioned about different platforms the only thing which I was using is meetup.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 22007, "end_char_idx": 26563, "text_template":
