starting a company and this was like one of the last ideas left in my PL statement bucket and I ended up launching it got good feedback and then since then the journey has been great uh then you got accepted right no no still then also we didn't get accepted really yeah this was a sixth rejection with Rag and AI based projects second time with AI you got rejected yeah yeah so even after failing seven times what kept you going no matter whatever you're doing you always stick to basic and Basics that's what do so this is startup HQ where tan startup is incubated so hello everyone today I have the honor to interview taranjit CEO and co-founder of mzero if I have to show you with an example how it impacts me in my apartment we have k sujan and me we split our rent and some amount is fixed some is repeating and some is variable so I have put it into m zero and every first of month if I say split my rent extra dollars of 90 let's say a $90 extra rent it automatically remembers rent of Ky sujan and mine and automatically divides it has a memory layer if you want to ask your manager today I want to take off it will remember that that you are going on a vacation one month later and will write that custom email so it is very useful for me and now let's get to know the Journey of thin what it took to build the startup today we have th here he had an incredible journey of getting into YC he applied seven times coming to Bay Area we are currently in startup HQ which is incubators for startups like you know for inspired startups like of and start now we have like you know these these buildings which are on lease and rented for the startups so that they can start their Journey so hi tan can you please introduce yourself hey uh like thank you for having me here I think really excited to be here I keep watching some of your videos and like it's like like fun to be doing one so thank you for this opportunity uh I think my journey started uh in India I did my undergrad in computer science I did work at PTM when it was was not a well-known brand I I did like a lot of uh I took like multiple attempts in starting my own company and it's been a journey of uh learnings and like failures and like reflecting what went wrong and then improving it into the next uh iteration currently I happen to run a company a scof out and Co the company name is mzero uh we are a open- source uh company we have like 22,000 GitHub Stars we are loved by our developers very much we are building like a long-term memory for large language models uh it's one of the most important problems in this uh AI geni era to solve and 22k get up sols 22 amazing yeah I mean like thank you all our like supporters for all the love I think without you we wouldn't be here excellent and first of all like I really want to admire how you you know made it finally you started with you know SAS explain how you started pitching to YC and how you pivoted to make it finally the seventh time in AI I think uh so I applied to YC for the first time in uh 2020 from India online yeah from India online so T say I've been just trying to apply uh the first time when we applied uh I was trying to build a alternate Android App Store uh we got Ed for an interview but were rejected uh but then we kept pursuing it and then it was a series of multiple uh I think pivots on the idea and even on the like team also like I was working with someone else before but uh uh went through like a journey of reflection also where in like initially the problem that I was trying to solve uh it felt like a problem but at a small scale then what happened that I left my job in October 201 22 right before this gen wave was about to start and I applied to YC I think it was like fourth or fifth time with idea which was like a GPT store which is what we have right now back then uh so gpt3 era at the time yeah so this is like I I I remember dates very well so August end May stability was launched and at that time I started like the resignation process like right I mean around that time only and 30th November 2022 uh I the GPT 3 is launched and then first December I think CH GPT was launched that's the time say and 6th December Co I launched this product which was like a GPD store and I applied to YC it was a late application but uh I think we didn't get selected I was solo also at that point of time and then I applied uh I got like good I think I didn't get like uh I mean to be clear like very the feedback that was missing but uh the", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx":

from the user so I kept improving I then applied again uh to YC but got uh rejected and then with same idea or different yeah it was like a yeah so what happened applied with GPT store only uh but there was like some modifications that I made and I think the common feedback that I got was like you know it will be better if you get a co-founder and then uh what happened that I focused Less on applying to Y and I focused more on solving or figuring out a problem uh at that point of time this GPT store led me to a problem which was like a developer tool problem where I realized that developers are struggling in creating AI applications so I built this product called embed chain and uh I have a longtime friend called DH Raj who is my co-founder in CTO right now we both met in undergrad College in 2012 which college uh so we went to a college in NOA it's called jss NOA uhh and both of us like did a lot of projects together in college uh and we also built a very popular open source alternative to kagle together so then we decided uh like back then this was happening I was launching I was like going through like multiple iterations on this developer tool product uh I ended up one I ended up at one form which was like embed chain launched it on GitHub it went viral uh I mean like got like I think 600 starts in 2 three days wow embed chain can you elaborate what is it so basically uh the language models they have like a training cut off date and they do not have context of your own data so let's say if you ask them you know how many emails in my Gmail inbox are talking about fixed deposits or credit card they don't know because they don't have the context of your Gmail inbox so there is this technique called RG which is retrieval augmentation rack so we built like a very simple I think the simple framework in the world to do RG back then oh and with with with Vector database or without uh with Vector database so we made it very easy for even like my brother who is like very beginner programmer to get started and build like a AI app back then this is like uh June 2023 when like the AI field is still L people are figuring out like what to do and it's difficult for them to get uh hold of these technical Concepts and we built this uh I I built it launched it and then like we ended up uh we got like good traction I think I wasn't expecting that I think I was like thinking to take like a in break because I've done like so many I think I was at a hacker house in Bangalore during this time at my at one of my very close friends he runs a company was staying with him for like 3 months I went there for like 7even days ended up staying for 3 months and this was like one of the last ideas left in my uh I think Plum statement bucket and I ended up launching it got good feedback and then since then the journey has been great uh then you got accepted right no no still then also we didn't get accept really yeah yeah yeah so the journey is so what happened that I uh we launched this uh I I still was like alone solo on this idea I launched it wrote like 200 emails to people in the valley uh about like you know raising like raising a round with them two of them responded uh uh one of them ended up investing and like helped me with my uh I mean help me in my further Journeys and the other person also helped and I came to I mean Valley like literally in just two days it was like uh I mean I'm just talking to them and like in 2 days I ended up being here uh my parents were very surprised with what and then desraj uh ended up joining as

sixth rejection yeah this was a sixth rejection with Rag and AI based projects second time with AI you got rejected yeah yeah and then what happened that uh I think uh uh the feedback that we got was good very like the feedback was you know you need to figure out more about what kind of use cases this rack framework will enable so we took that feedback uh in a positive way and went deep we started doing a lot of improvements on the product and now this is like December uh 2023 January 2024 which is this year like starting we ended up realizing like a very fundament problem uh which uh is what MZ is about uh we changed the name from embed chain to mzero we did like a lot of product improvements and well and then this time uh we applied to YC like YC opens up their early applications so we applied to YC this time and uh this is like March uh 2024 and this time we are already in like you know uh I mean I think we were like uh we just applied with the application we got an interview and this time we got selected wow and you know this this year we have three batches of YC's coming and usually though usually two batches but three batches because the craze for AI is insane yeah just like how inspiring is the Journey of th it is also off the app called Mumu which started from Palo Alto California as well and has reached almost 23 million users and I use it every single time I look at the market trends or if I have to look at China and Hong Kong's Market because there are rarely stock brokerages apps in America like muu which allow you to which allow you to invest in Hong Kong's or China's stock market and look at the level two data with that much information and just like 62% of Americans in the US who have a stock brokerage account you can be one of them it's completely legal on F1 H1B visa and get started immediately by going to start. momo.com sing inusa and get up to 15 free stocks and 88.1% apy go start right away what an incredible journey so I really want to ask you in this process uh what is the difference between fifth sixth and seventh in your product m zero embedded chain so feedback Implement so it was first a rag pip I want to integrate in my email and it will be a chat bot now what is extra now than before I think so fifth time pay uh there was this product called cook up. which is the GPT store that I mentioned it was a application limit product what does it do uh if you know the GPT store right now you can go and create your custom gpts so it was like a natural language based interface where you can type in give me like a uh restaurant give me like a app which takes in the name of dish or name of ingredients that I have and give me like a proper recipe so it started like that uh that was like application Level product was P I figured that the it was too early and we figured that maybe the users that we getting uh are not uh uh finding this product much valuable the sixth product which was embed chain RG framework the feedback that we got from YC was uh uh maybe you need to figure out like two three big use cases where you feel like this is super valuable because when you're building like a framework Frameworks are hard to monetize so you need to figure out like what is something that will monetize on top of framework and what is something like a general purpose framework would do well that was the feedback that we got from YC and we when we were working on this feedback we got feedback from our users about this memory problem so what happened that this year starting and last year December we started noticing that a lot of our users are doing frequent interactions with AI models and they have to just tell them everything again and again so let's say if I doing like you know one interaction with chat GPT

so what happened that this year starting and last year December we started noticing that a lot of our users are doing frequent interactions with AI models and they have to just tell them everything again and again so let's say if I doing like you know one interaction with chat GPT right now I will that my name is sanjit Singh I based here I grew up in India I do XYZ I love ABC so these sort of things I have to tell CH GPD again and again what happened in February CH GPD ended up launching a early feature of their memory which is what they try to solve it for but uh the idea is that these models they are stateless they they are sort of dumb in a way where they don't know or they don't remember things about you so we figured that this is happening because in their architecture they don't have this you know concept of memory big de like like I've met you next time let's say if I'm meeting you again I'll remember that you were wearing like a black color T-shirt I met you at the uh SF I Met You in SF right so I will maybe crack like some joke about SF or maybe like say something which is like related to this meeting right that's something that llms can't do by themselves so then we started focusing on this problem statement specifically and uh this problem statement is like an emerging problem statement right now I think only open CH GPD no other llms right now have memory built in with them so so only open ey and uhgb and also like I think Google has memory right no so gole no jini doesn't have any memory perplexity has it perplexity also doesn't have memory uh what they do is I mean if you just chat in the same thread the context is pass but let's say if you go back and be like who am I sort of question it won't remember oh maybe you they might build like a profile where you can add in details so that's all they remember but right now that's not there so they have chat history but not memory but not memory yeah open ey has memory it remembers who you are so memory is important for example H like for example I put in like for examp and there is extra amount this divide I have to put in the fam formula every single time open air doesn't remember CH doesn't remember I have to put it again have to tell it every single time and that is feature I really want frustrating yeah yeah so so we are building like a so we are building like a developer tool but what we are doing is since this is a problem that all the users who are using like LMS will have so we are building like a playground sort of feature then you also can come and use it we built like a very good Chrome extension for cloud uh uh my co-founder launch launched it last week and that's like a button with says m zero it comes next to the send button in Chrome extension in the cloud and you can use it to add had any memory or send it out there excellent and since you have done R to does it have a feature for example problem when I'm talking to chat gbt there are so many history topics do you have the ability with rag to add Hao topics thousand topics of History can be you know Consolidated into five or six that I can click using rag is that also top of your mind so that's not a problem that can be solved using rag uh that's a problem that involves summarization so maybe you have like you know 100 subjects or 100 topics out there you're trying to condense it into like you know 10 things out there and on that also chats so thousand chats of History yeah Consolidated into five Oh you mean the chat history oh yeah that's what memory will do it so that's something that you can do using rag but what will happen that rag is not the best way to do it so I mean there are like technical limitations when you're doing rag memory may what happens that we building like this technology which understands okay this is a kind of information that should be stored in this way and this should be retrieved in this way whenever this things comes up so you can give your thousands of charts out there we'll make sense of it and we'll give you like you know a profile so you'll see", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 11111, "end_char_idx": 15877, "text_template":

solved using rag uh that's a problem that involves summarization so maybe you have like you know 100 subjects or 100 topics out there you're trying to condense it into like you know 10 things out there and on that also chats so thousand chats of History yeah Consolidated into five Oh you mean the chat history oh yeah that's what memory will do it so that's something that you can do using rag but what will happen that rag is not the best way to do it so I mean there are like technical limitations when you're doing rag memory may what happens that we building like this technology which understands okay this is a kind of information that should be stored in this way and this should be retrieved in this way whenever this things comes up so you can give your thousands of charts out there we'll make sense of it and we'll give you like you know a profile so you'll see your profile your all attributes maybe based in ABC uh does this works at this runs this these kinds of thing and that's how your profile gets created Incredible Journey so seventh time when you got accepted the biggest difference is you are solving a biggest problem in M that memory is lacking and we discussed problem both problems are one is solved and second you are in the process of solving right yes you told me that the biggest challenge for anyone to make a company and apply to VY in India is that product you can make the product but it's really difficult to do anything after that finding co-founder finding that and I was at an event of Southwest Commons the biggest one of the biggest wec here they said they get 80,000 emails in in a week from India no everywhere all over the world oh my God 80,000 emails and you sent emails too and it stood out so can you share product to this how how you made it what it takes I think uh India I mean uh uh I think India also is a land of opportunities and the startup system has matured a lot uh some of my uh I mean I've been early at PTM I've been early at katab book so I've seen a lot of people around me starting their own companies but I think like if you're trying to build like a technology company which is like you know pure technology company it will still work well in India but the point is that in Bay Area I mean you might uh find it uh you know more favorable because people take bet on new technologies people take bet on something which sounds weird may not make money right now but may end up making money in the future so I think uh that's one thing that I feel uh is there and I I feel like uh India also you can like you know do startups uh what did what something that I learned and improved in my journey was ke rather than just building like a cool product if I can figure out actually what is the you know user problem that's there why is it important uh for the user that that problem should be solved like there are many many problems that I have right I can say like you know I'm my shoes are not good but that's the problem that is not important for me to solve right now right so then that if that problem is important for the user to be solved and then if I feel like you are one of the best persons to solve that problem so that's what the founder market fit thing is right so I feel like if you try to figure out let's say I can't go and like run a uh maybe like a delivery business right I I I don't know much I can figure it out but I don't know much about it right so I feel like if you focus on truly understanding what is a problem once you start doing that everything else generally happens in place I also used to feel like startup is some you know magic recipe which I don't have it but I took like uh seven attempts in starting a company not the YC application I've been doing I've been trying to do uh I think my own startup since 2012 and each uh attempt that I took uh taught me you know that if you understand there is like a particular type of user their problem why that problem is very important for them to solve and then if there are many users of that kind it's not like you're solving like problem which is specific to one user you need to have like you know many users which has the same flum then you are much closer to doing a startup and then eventually if you build a product if the product is clicking with a lot of users it's solving a problem what will happen happen that uh things will start falling into place because you you're building something that people want since they want it they love it they will use it they will talk about it they'll tell it to their friends family and more people will come more people will use a product and you will see like a user growth and that's something", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 14918, "end_char_idx":

come more people will use a product and you will see like a user growth and that's something that you know uh is the most important thing for like you know getting a startup of the ground where there's a product that's growing people are using it so that's something that I always tell people uh to do it and that's what I started doing popular say for example you should start a startup only when everyone is telling you not to do it and you still do it and you're motivated to do it start then you should not do it yeah so even after failing seven times what kept you going uh I think uh uh so it's a combination of few things first uh uh so my father used to my father has a watch shop like he I mean repairs and sells watch I used to uh sit on that shop with him since class third so class think I was decently good at studies my studies were manage so he would like call me on a shop and our like house and Shop is like literally 5 minutes so I would go on his shop and sit with him uh I even used to I still know how to repair a watch I can do like a I learned a lot uh like while working alongside him and uh that time only I learned the importance of Gala right you know in India like we have this you know uh place where we keep all the money so I used to see my father uh I I think saw it uh happening then I used to run the shop my father would go to uh Market to get uh you know things but I would run the shop on my own so I think that thing taught me basics of a business uh it was like a brick and mortar shop but Basics clear so I think that uh inspired me I don't know when it hit me but I was like K I will do something of my own second uh I started uh quizzing in my school days I used to do a lot of it quizzing there was this quiz called TS it wi so I was like a regular participant there and I could never uh I mean win it uh I think uh it was like a very uh prestigious event uh which used to happen Citywide but I learned a lot about Silicon Valley back from then to was say I got like very much interested in computer science I and when I got interested I think I became good at it what show is it uh it's called TCS it it's a program yeah Tata consultancy TCS it Vis so they have like two quizzes TCS it it Vis and Tata Crucible okay so Tata Crucible is for like MBA students thes is for like school students training training it's like a It Quiz National n Nationwide it's a competition that runs and it focuses specifically on it quizzing it's not GK quizzing so uh to that inspired I mean that drove me towards computer and then I was like I mean I'm generally uh generally like to learn new things and I want to do something which is much much much B so that kept me motivating and uh so say I've been taking attempt so each attempt uh was difficult in its own way like co-founders thing not working but what happened that I think there is some some some sort of inner uh Drive uh which is like you know it will happen we we'll figure it out let's you know keep taking attempts uh if you stop taking attempts uh I think that's the biggest mistake that people do make it's hard I'm not saying it's easy it has been hard for me but I also figured out like you know there were few problems that I realized ke maybe like there is like a financial stability in my life that I need to sort so I soled it first yeah I started understanding more deeply about why why should you build a company it's not so I got a lot of ground groundedness from my parents they are very humble uh so I think that kept that also kept me grounded no matter whatever you're doing you always stick to basic and Basics Tey but that's what kept me going so your family always motivated you yeah I mean like they have been a", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx":

from my parents they are very humble uh so I think that kept that also kept me grounded no matter whatever you're doing you always stick to basic and Basics Tey but that's what kept me going so your family always motivated you yeah I mean like they have been a constant source of motivation I think father train I didn't used to like it back then because my other friends would be playing and I would be sitting at a shop with him but now I feel it's so valuable so did you make a plan B it set of savings for like let's say 6 months one year like a plan B savings when you quit your job what was that uh I think uh biggest thing that I learned one of the biggest thing that I learned is but finances mess up when you have like things around you that are dependent on you so what I did was I figured ke uh the reason why uh I figured that startups take longer like I started my journey in October 20122 now it's iig if I can figure out like a decent Runway so that I don't have to worry about at the end of month I don't have this money so that way I felt ke uh it becomes easier then there was this thing key things don't work out account will start going down right but I think that I don't know why but I was like I was very much excited do it figure out but there would be like one company who would take a bet on again and like you work so that will happen so that way I think excellent like I think when you don't have any Plan B you give 120% I think yeah no for sure Plan B will make you weak because you'll always be like same I mean student YouTube channel start I had $300 in my bank account I gave six months to YouTube channel that's why I'm sitting next to you so I think it it has lot of truth to it in the space of AI there are so many competitors coming you know llm also features how do you say how do you stay competitive in this space I think startup like fundamental Advantage which is like you know they move very fast and they're very close to their user so right now I think both of us thankfully are with us we are developers they're building a product for Developers you know this is how this should be built this is how this should be built and then by default uh early pH of startup where like there are few cracked people or there are like few crazy people who are like you know so so much motivated about the problem statement so much motivated about creating an impact that they are doing their 500% th000 percentage and they'll move mountains in just like few hours so I think that's the advantage that any startup has byy I feel like I mean like this is like a new paradigm that has come up nobody knows what will happen so the best uh way to stay competitive is stick to Basics like you know uh just keep the feedback loop tight uh whatever you're are building if you know who your user users are what are their problems and are your is your product addressing that and if you just keep improving the product I think yeah you will survive and you say competitive exactly like I think just like you know pictures in that in that TV show 17 years college student their pendrive say but they still stay strong and still get the funding yeah so I think you saying that you have the power with the best engineers in the team to Pivot at any point of l h I think we'll do whatever is needed for the company to be successful I think yeah that's the Moto and in terms of hiring it said that one to two Engineers who are Top Notch can do the best work rather than 10 average Engineers how do you hire how CTO your team is of four how do you hire the best talent I think the best thing that works for us is we have like a open source project we hired this person called Dave from India we hired pratique from us both of them reached out to us theyve started I wrote about him on LinkedIn and Twitter also in his journey is very Inspire inspiring he's like in a some small town in Gujarat he started contributing all of a sudden to like bzero

out to us theyve started I wrote about him on LinkedIn and Twitter also in his journey is very Inspire inspiring he's like in a some small town in Gujarat he started contributing all of a sudden to like bzero wow and he was just contributing like I mean no interaction with us he was just making pull request and pull request was getting marged we're giving him feedback he was addressing the feedback and then I just spoke with him and I liked him I was like you know let's figure out if we can collaborate and then we ended up you know getting him full time similarly pratique uh who is based in us uh discovered us like from YC and lingin he reached out to us with a very personalized I mean we are building memory to personalization and his email was one of the best personal personalized emails that we ever saw and it was super clear with why we should hire him like he was upfront in the value that he brings to the team so I feel like open source teams pass like they have like a edge wherein you see like people who are contributing to the repo making it better and if you just talk to them and see if they are at a stage in their life where they can collaborate more deeply with you you can build like a team there and uh that is a good uh way because the engineers or the people that are contributing they've already navigated the code base they know this is how it works they even are contributing without your guidance wow so open source brings so many benefits because when you have the product open source you are making it safe because everyone can contribute so how many developers contributed to your project to become like 22,000 Stars I don't remember the exact number but I think now we have more than 150 at least more than 140 150 contributors out there we have seen contributors from every part of the world uh I mean and this is like such a uh grateful thing for us wherein the world is helping us improve excellent and how do you measure growth so that you can continue grow and like you know get more funding if needed so how do you measure success and growth in your startup I for us uh I mean though we have like a good number of stars but the only thing that we focus on is adding value so right now whatever developers are using our product uh we are just trying to make like a very optimal low latency system for them so that if they add like this memory solution in their product the product experience becomes much much much better their eventual users are happy so they are happy so that's where we are happy so we are it's like a I mean it's very simple for us like our growth is uh the number of users or number of developers that we can make happy because once they are happy their users are happy excellent and last question will be which I asking every founder these days is would you chase success slow and build character or success fast and build ego and exit maybe hypothetically I think is there not a third option there is like uh fast and uh character but there is I think I would for that uh so I I was uh one of the early team members at kabuk and kabuk went like a crazy scale in India one thing that I learned there was like this exact same thing whereing like super super growth mode like Indian Merchants love kabuk a lot and down to earth uh like humble team good ethical people there uh who generally have like I mean they are like one of the smart people I mean a lot of the early team at kabuk was from ID Bombay so very smart Engineers uh I I I think uh uh and still like you know very uh good they taught me like a lot of things a lot of things that I learned in my journey is a combination of things that I did at kabuk also so I would like I mean if I have a choice I would always prefer to build character uh and grow fast yeah excellent excellent thank you thank you so much that I learned a lot go check out mzero it's super useful and thank you so much again and share with the friend who can be
