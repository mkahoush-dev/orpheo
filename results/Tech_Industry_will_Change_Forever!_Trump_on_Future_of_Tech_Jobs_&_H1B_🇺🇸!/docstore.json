elected and this video is going to be the brutal truth you should hear because many people will predict the positive side many people will predict the negative side but all those predictions will fail because as someone who has been in college when Trump was the president as someone who was working in Tech when Trump was the president and then switched to Biden's Administration I have seen the unpredictive nature of trump and I'm going to give you all the facts and to tell you what you should hope in your future as a student coming to the US or in terms of future as a tech person in the US I think that anyone who gives you a definitive answer on what they think the future is is like full of it because like there's no predicting with Donald Trump like it all depends on who Lobby him it all depends on who he's fighting with it all depends on who's kissing his ass like it all just depends on so many things if there was one thing that was predictable during the first four years of trump it was that nothing is predictable wow number one do not try to predict anything like I want to tell you when Trump was the president he did tariffs on China but those tariffs were not applicable for all companies Apple was was Exempted for tariffs on iPhone Apple watch and Mac products why because they LED whatever Trump says that's the unpredictable nature of Donald Trump that anything can happen at any point of time based on who is lobbying Donald Trump and at what price and what suggestions they give lobing is in the form of money which is also considered kind of legal corruption in the US or it could be just sort of formal advice that is given to the president or the cabinet of the current incumbent president before sharing the next brutal truth I want to tell you next four years it's going to be clickbait news which is going to scare the out of you whether it's Times of India or any Indian news or American News because that's how they make more money and a simple example could be they will highlight that Donald Trump has win the house the Senate and president and Supreme Court too but the truth is also in 2016 as well Donald Trump had won the presidency Senate and House as well so he had the trifecta in 2016 too it might be more powerful in 2024 but don't think that people in House and Senate are stupid that they will just you know do anything they want to so that's why do not stop your decision to study in the US if you are and our consultancy fly with sing is there to help you you will find all the free resources on fly withing whether it's letters of recommendation or you want to get helped to shortless universities you will get the support you need and I can proudly say fly with sing is arcc credited only few consultancies in India are arcc credited and I can proudly say it is partnered with admit card so go check out go to fly with Singh and get started with your study abroad Journey now next brutal truth Elon Musk and Donald Trump partnership is not as easy as it sounds like so Elon Musk has 8% 6 to 8% share of Eves sold in China and he he definitely wants to increase it because if China which is close to implementing full self-driving of Tesla in China he will get lot of sales his market value of Tesla will increase and Tesla has reached trillion dollar market cap after Donald Trump became president so he really wants to get more out of China and increase his business worldwide at the same time Donald Trump wants to put tariffs in China and in 2019 Donald Trump and China's prime minister XI jingping came to a deal both sides trade wars were happening so in this trade Wars that may start again who is going to win is is it Elon Musk who will maybe reduce the number of tariffs and Chase the win or is it going to be maybe Donald Trump who is going to put tariffs no matter what it is completely unpredictable so that's why you should not even try to predict what's going to happen at the end of the day American corporations are going to win no matter what happens some will win those who are able to Lobby the most just like apple lobbied for exemption from tariffs that were imposed for China imported goods So based on whoever Lobby is the best they will win and in the end there will be more job growth in the US regardless number three the opportunities in AI will increase because the AI executive order that Biden put in 2023 October that basically says that you need to have standards for AI and if something bad happens due to AI such such as the movies you have seen for example upgrade is a very good movie in which AI does really bad uh other is Space Odyssey which is a movie which a lot of American students and American AI enthusiasts have seen which AI does really bad and takes control over human being so basically Biden's AI executive order is if AI does something really bad the companies should", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4954, "text_template":

share the training information to the government and Republicans all the other side say that that can actually lead to trade secrets if training data is shared then trade secrets are basically shared so they want to cancel this executive order and AI Innovation can actually actually accelerate after Trump administration because of the deregulation and this will create probably more opportunities for everyone to grab an AI more competition more opportunities and ease of business Number Four rise in cyber security Donald Trump wants to really go tough against China because earlier China found the hack of using some of the US servers like on like on some Cloud platforms now he really wants to fight even tougher on those and increase in cyber security efficiency of the system you know with cyber security being wable there is a potential of $10 trillion to be lost in cyber security hacks but 99% of these hacks can be avoided by simple cyber security principles simple clean habits and he wants to encourage these habits to even more companies so that we are able to fight this cyber security War on a stronger end and there will be more opportunities and cyber security coming up for sure number four the web 3 era is coming back crypto currencies the cost of bitcoin ethereum you saw the spike in the price after Trump won now what's going to happen is if I share the details in the US Bitcoin and ethereum are considered Commodities and rest are considered Securities and securities go through lot of regulations because lot of scams can happen for example example FTX was was a scam that happened and many many people worldwide suffered because of FTX not giving your cryptocurrencies back from your wallet so because of that there were a lot of regulations but now Donald Trump wants to you know make us cryptocurrency Market the biggest in the world and because of that there'll be definitely more opportunities coming in web 3 development apps development the use cases of these currencies and some decentralizing of social media and more apps can hopefully come because the regulations will be far less this time and this is also very unpredictable because the cost of cryptocurrency should be equated to how much use case is there and currently use case hasn't increased as much in the last four years if the use case increases then there will be more demand as well and that is still very unpredictable and last the future of stem op and h48 when Donald Trump was the president this was very very unpredictable to tell whether stem op will be canceled or not because he did try to cancel stem op just because it was not passed around the 60% majority in House and Senate it did not go through even if he wanted to but now since he has majority in both and if all the Democrats in House and Senate vote for that bill then only it can be passed of course he has more power now but still there are checks and balances and because Elon musk's company Tesla has so many H1B workers I think he will definitely be actually lobbing maybe possibly against that bill as well so it's still very unpredictable questionable I cannot answer these questions so that's why the biggest advice I ask you to do is just do not predict and play bye the biggest hope you can have right now is us is the land of opportunities and will possibly be the land of opportunities if immigrants stay currently the biggest Google search was by US citizens mainly especially by women who want to immigrate to New Zealand Australia Canada and this spiked by 3,", "mimetype":
