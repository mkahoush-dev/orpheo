many other rappers for example Microsoft GitHub co-pilot is a rapper now in 2024 we are reaching the era of Agents when they can actually act like you can you share what are the futures of job in the world of AI you see around you so hello everyone today we have sagnik anupam who needs little introduction because in 2020 he first of all got into MIT only five to seven students at the time used to get into MIT and plus he has been up toate in the era of eii innovation his class work he just explained me that it's up to date even till the Innovations we have seen till gpt3 MIT is very fast moving and we will get to learn more about EI with sagnik so hi sagnik can you please introduce yourself so yeah so hi everyone I'm sagnik um I am a recent graduate from MIT I just graduated a few days ago and I am going to start my PhD at the University of Pennsylvania in fall and uh with a focus in programming languages as well as machine learning so yeah amazing so let's start with three reasons you think that you made it to Mid um all right three reasons okay that's uh I'll have to narrow down a lot of things I think um I think the main reason that I uh feel like really shown through was sort of my Um passion for working on research and working on research projects um when I was in high school I worked on bunch of research projects as well as a bunch of like stem projects that really really interested me and I think that some of those like projects were really really instrumental in my application and talking about what I learned and how I did those projects um I've been working in machine learning since roughly um about 10th grade or so so that's when I first got involved with machine learning and so yeah working on machine learning projects working on um Linguistics and other sort of tangential feeds related to machine learning was sort of the main driving force um in behind like what I did in high school um so yeah that was that I think um obviously I think um marks are important so I would say that I think I had um acceptable marks in my high school so I think I checked off the boxes um regarding that and then um I think finally I think that um a good application like has a powerful essay and like tells a story in a compiling way and um well I I don't have any feedback on my application but I think that it got the job done so um yeah so I basically talked a lot about my passion for machine learning my passion for research um some of the Linguistics um competitions I did like the olympiads and stuff and so that was basically what um and this combination of machine learning and Linguistics is what I mostly put in my application incredible according to the CDs score as well if you have heard common data set for MIT that also says you know academics are top there to get into mid so very well said so can you please share three most inspiring innovations that have recently happened in AI that have influenced you a lot so will preclude that by asking how recent so what's what's recent to you um uh I think last two years you know since the ER of GPD GP right okay um so I think some of the things I'm most excited by um well um the first one is Alpha geometry which is which came out in January I think it's super exciting it is a machine learning model that uses large language models as well as um some traditional symbolic methods and basically uh is able to solve IMO geometry problems which is like which are super super difficult and like um is just a crazy difficult task and the performance that we have seen in those models is is like amazing so I think that's really exciting so um solving IMO math problems using AI um the second sort of main Innovation that I think um was also really exciting so it goes back a bit further um it was using similar techniques for uh program synthesis which is the sort of the task of generating code using machine learning models and um as well as other like traditional methods so I think a good hybrid example of this was dreamcoder and um the third excitement like the exciting project that I discovered was updating dreamcoder using large language models so you swap out the one of the components in dreamcoder using an llm and then you get like amazing boost in performance and that paper was called Lio so Lio dream C and Alpha geometry are sort of the three like advances in AI over the past few years that I think are really cool and really amazing and they sort of like led to each other so dream coders architecture influence Lilo and then um we see like llms being adapted more and more across different tasks so that's where Alpha geometry came in with the math to M so yeah incredible would you define dream coder similar to GitHub co-pilot to generate code I think the main difference in dreamcoder", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4885, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}",

the math to M so yeah incredible would you define dream coder similar to GitHub co-pilot to generate code I think the main difference in dreamcoder is I think um so copilot is what um I think the architecture of copilot broadly is mostly llm focused and LM based um dreamcoder had a very simple neural network like it is not it does not use billions of parameters it does not use um like a language model at all and the idea behind a incoder is basically to have um like have a neural network that is used for sort of predicting which chunks of code are like good like in terms of solving a particular problem or a particular task but there's like other systems that are working to constantly refactor the code and come up with basically good subm modules and so the main power dreamcoder is not really generating like long strings of code to solve a problem it's basically finding like useful tactics techniques which are these small sub modules that you can chain together in order to like solve like a crazy like big problem so a quick example of that would be like for example if you're trying to device a sorting algorithm the first thing the dreamcoder does is like try to find a simple like sort of piece of code that can like swap different elements in an array together or something right and then you combine those like what what sequence do you do the swaps in what are the conditions under which the swaps Ur and so it keeps iterating on these and sort of filling in these holes until it comes up with a complete starting algorithm from beginning to end and it can do that knowing just like the programming language that you're using and the task that you're like the input and output for the task that you're trying to solve and you would not need to train it on like like you know you don't need to train it on the whole of GitHub you don't need to train it on like all these like large code bases and so I think that's really powerful so it's more of algorithm than Ai and LMS right it is well it is a neuros symbolic model so it uses like a neural network to do the so it has some AI in it but the refactoring is done by algorithms so there's a lot of like program analysis research that is used in order to find what is like a good program or a good solution and what was the third one you said uh so the third one is called Lilo um Lilo substitutes the one of the ideas behind dreamcoder is just enumerating a lot of programs and checking them to make sure that like you know which ones work which ones don't work so the idea is that the large line model is generating some of these um distractions and like writing um like rewriting these code this code so that it becomes more understandable to humans and also helps the model learn how to solve these problems much faster so that's the main idea yeah third part right and then next like token prediction type of task next like token sequence which would complete the program in second type of models you treat a program as something that has holes in it and you're trying to fill those holes function so you fill that in and you keep chaining these functions together like more functional Programming type of approach sequence of functions sequence of functions can solve your task so you can write an insertion sort by chaining function together like you do in list or you can write it like as a python like model and all that so those are the two different approaches so to give some background to the audience so there is you know these llms are based on supervised learning just say up hello or let's say you train a model based on a name like Hello Apple hello orange and now next time you're trying to predict if you just write a it will automatically say apple that's how supervised learning works now you are breaking it down into chunks of code and then training on top of that right so what it can do is it can examine the code it already has in its data set and say it can like generate like if you give it a task like oh generate a sorting algorithm for me it can reference that andite you a sorting algorithm in this case sorting Ali in our training data unsort", "mimetype":

call fined now to give some related innovation that are very much connected so 2023 was the era of llms plus their rappers for example perplexity is just a rapper but it has become a unicorn and there are many other rappers for example Microsoft GitHub co-pilot is a rapper now in 2024 we are reaching the era of Agents when they can actually act like you now we haven't reached There Yet now can you share what do you think is the future like is rapper is the highest level of innovation we can imag imagine is Agent or we can imagine even Innovation beyond that level so I think that um well I think rappers can be there's lots of like fine tuning and Architectural stuff going on so I think um there's of course a lot of innovation because um a general purpose large language model might not be the best model for your task you might actually decide that you want to fine tunit more on specific custom data sets or propriety data sets that you have which in turn will like might make like the large language model perform very well on your task so that is a thing that we have constantly been seeing um so for a lot of like for a lot of AI rapper products like it's not simply just a call to like a general large language model so I think that's very exciting that we're going to see more and more about the limits of like fine tuning and what we can actually do in order to overcome those limits and what kind of like data we actually need to overcome those um restrictions on like sort of um what the performance restrictions on general purpose LMS agents on the other hand I think are really interesting because when so there are there's in traditional like sort of optimization Theory you have something known as like swarm intelligence which is this idea where if every if you have a swarm of different agents that are all sort of identified by some variable and they are all working towards the same goal so you have some hyper parameters that are identifying these agents and then they're all working towards the same goal where do they converge is like a very interesting question and this is often used in order to solve optimization problem so if you ever wonder what is like a good architecture for a neural network or if you ever wonder how do you like find the optimal weights and biases of like the neural network these kind of problems have often obviously there are like existing like non swarm intelligence methods but there are also swarm intelligence methods where you just give like a bunch of randomly initialized like sort of Agents a sort of a metric to optimize by and then they converge onto this Optimum metric and that is sorry can you break down swarm intelligent methods I'm sorry I'm not as in touch with the soig basically you have like 30 sort of Agents right you initialize them randomly and then some updating method you update each agent's position um in like sort of 2D suppose 2D space suppose you have like so try to visualize like a bunch of birds basically flying around like so they're flying at random at first right and then what you're doing is you're trying to update it to find what is the best solution graph function which is like I'm trying to find the minimum of this graph which in this Cas is minimum error rate or something some some sort of metric like that mple agents the minimum and they're going to come at the minimum from different positions on this 2D plane randomly initialize different positions over multiple iterations of this eventually convergence possible depending on the function that you're seeing convergence

like value so this has lots of interesting applications to say what is the best newal network architecture what is the solution to this this like longstanding math problem which is like just very very difficult to compute like using traditional methods so you can have all these sort of like challenges which are now like your agents are slightly more intelligent than traditional agents where you just have like a hyper parameter or two simple mathematical function so that is the exciting you mentioned you work on neuros symbolic machine learning models at MIT so can you share the concept of neuros symbolic a and potential advantages and the relationships you have seen between you know how we as human beings are intellectual versus neural networks sure I can try to answer okay so neural net so neuros symbolic AI first of all um is basically this idea that you don't have to do everything through the neural network it is okay to have some symbolic module that is like handling the symbolic aspects of data and what this basically down like p a word I break down neuros symbolic can you break down the whole word thinking about neuros symbolic models right so the neuro part refers to the neural networks or like the sort of the advances in machine learning which we have seen over the past like um I don't know 40 years or so right the symbolic aspect is that you don't have to do everything through the neural network you can choose to have some sort of algorithms or some sort of like previous knowledge that you have about the structure of the data that you're looking at and then use that in order to support the neural network so an example of this for is like simply is just the idea of like trying to generate code right so if you want to generate code through a large language model you're just generating it through whatever you're prompting the llm with but in a neuros symbolic model you have a neural network which can be used to sort of discover like different like sub modules or subprograms that are useful and a symbolic module that is actually like checking them for like you know how good is this like How likely is it to like you know solve this problem does it compile and like all these correctness sort of issues that often pop up when you just give something entirely over to an llm so you don't have to worry about the correctness you don't have to worry about the sort of compilation times and all these like sort of additional metrics that we know from previous uh programming experience before llms but instead the idea is yeah you have one component that handles generation and then one component that handles sort of checking and like validating that the code that you're generating is good oh so it's more like human being like one person is creating like an llm creating code creating language creating intelligence which is in the shape of language and other person is checking so it's like more like an agent model and more similar to human being exactly so yeah so so the benefit of this and the benefit of this approach is of course that you don't have to worry about correctness from the llm side so you don't need to focus on training the llm to sort of um make sure that it's guaranteeing like correct code all the time whereas you can just focus on like you know maybe it can generate small chunks of code like a decent percentage of the time and that's kind of the so your focus shifts and I think a great example of this is the IMO like Alpha geometry which was basically using AI to solve IMO geometry problems so the thing is that there's very little training data compared to like the other tasks that we have on IMO geometry problems because fun fact there are not that many IO geometry problems around right so what what Alpha geometry did was they synthetically generated a bunch of geometric constructions and they analyzed those geometric constructions like exhaustively like just checking you know is this the midpoint of this triang like this side of a triangle is this angle correct like they just analyzed all these random constructions that they generated and then they had an llm generate like like fine tune on this and generate like um more constructions and", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 11929, "end_char_idx": 17222, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}",

correct code all the time whereas you can just focus on like you know maybe it can generate small chunks of code like a decent percentage of the time and that's kind of the so your focus shifts and I think a great example of this is the IMO like Alpha geometry which was basically using AI to solve IMO geometry problems so the thing is that there's very little training data compared to like the other tasks that we have on IMO geometry problems because fun fact there are not that many IO geometry problems around right so what what Alpha geometry did was they synthetically generated a bunch of geometric constructions and they analyzed those geometric constructions like exhaustively like just checking you know is this the midpoint of this triang like this side of a triangle is this angle correct like they just analyzed all these random constructions that they generated and then they had an llm generate like like fine tune on this and generate like um more constructions and so it suggested to the sort of the symbolic module to oh put a midpoint here or like you know measure this angle here stuff like that so constructions like that right and then there was a symbolic module that was constantly checking for properties so it was just checking does this midpoint imply that these two are equal like it's using all these geometry theorems that it already knows in order to check the relationships between everything and so this sort of dual pairing where one llm is generating all the constructions and all the extra like geometric information that you need and then there's a symbolic module that is checking that this is useful for the problem this is correct and this is like what kind of new relations does this Inspire and stuff like that and so these two modules working together manag to solve like a very like like just get amazing performance on like the IMO geometry Challenge and that's I think I think that's really really exciting when you split up like the neural aspect and the symbolic aspect like that so that is why I'm excited about neuros symbolic models can it replace humans I think it depends on what replacement um is I think that the I think I try to think about machine learning more in terms of practical like sort of applications so where where do like people um work and like where do like where do these models really really shine um I think we'll always have IM IMO geometry problems around because humans like challenging themselves and humans like solving this um I think that at the end of the day we're going to see that a lot of um a lot of challenging problems can be augmented by Machine learning models but I'm not quite sure that um we are at a point where we will always get 100% accuracy on every single task ever so I think I think it's a matter of time it's it's sort of too early to say right now about like what exactly can be replaced and what cannot be replaced but I think over time what we're going to find out is um we have some models that are amazing at some specific tasks and others that are not so I think it's just going to um end up in terms of like that so so it's going to be very task specific let's zoom out a little bit into AI projects can you share what are the most interesting and useful AI projects and usefulness of AI you see around you is it AI agents multimodality because Nvidia CEO just said that every country needs to have its own large language model Spanish Hindi Punjabi or you know marati Telo every language needs to have their own model so that we can build up on the multimodality and make many models perfect so so yeah um I think that in general when I'm thinking about like um how Global like AI has become and like how we are seeing all these sort of like um local languages that are like you know have their own llms now I think um some of the most exciting uses for me at least are like um especially I feel like we can do problems like translation and like problems like just just massive like text problems that were just not doable at that scale before like you can understand like a lot about like um you know massive amounts of textual data that is being gathered but I think what's more exciting is that llms also have like promising sort of um like we' seen that llms have a lot of promise even in data that's not strictly like Text data so for example if you have like data like for example programs right code or equations and you're seeing these sort of like these new approaches that are coming up in order to solve problems in these domains I think that is what personally is most exciting for me so when you have like models that have like so much language like trained on so much language data like how do they perform on like other tasks and how how do they understand like non-textual like sort of tasks and also how do they like what kind of like information are they collecting from the rest of the data set so for example if you try to like take an", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 16153, "end_char_idx": 21206, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator":

chess games but it also has a lot of data related to like the individual profiles of the chess players themselves so like what does it know about like and I use know in the sort of the loosest way possible but like what can it figure what kind of relationships can it figure out between like certain opening moves versus like certain like in-game moves like like what's this relation and what's this Dynamic and those things are really I think exciting to think about because so far like a lot of problems that we've seen before LMS have just been you have this one data set that has like these kind of it has a lot of these input variables and you have that output variable so yeah so you have you have a lot of this data the model just looks at the input variables that we think are good for the output variable but then in a post LM word what excites me is that now we have a lot of like language data that it's been collected from a lot of different sources so how do you use that and then sort of like approach this traditional problems that only had like you know Jess moves or only had like medical records and like only had these like sort of individual ual like sort of sort of non-text data so what kind of like relations can you find out between them so yeah yeah incredible answer now what are the three dangers of adversarial attacks AI dangers you have seen around you and what you have done to stop them sure um okay what I've done to stop them is well your Pap try it so I think a basic one for example is data poisoning right so if you're input data or raining data is just not working the way it is so if someone has obviously like maliciously modified it or if someone has like or if just by oversight you have just missed some component data that's not the way it should be there's a huge chance you can generate something that is like problematic or that is like dangerous and um sometimes things might just end up breaking and so let me add an example a quick example is just now GPD 40 was jailbroken and there's a prompt created that can enable GPD 40 to in fact tell you how to create bombs tell you you know destroy the world that was so dangerous yeah go ahead sorry yeah so so yeah so I think that's like that's a very interesting aspect of this where I think that yeah so finding out prompts like that or finding out stuff like that can have really bad impacts on you know end users and often times like people will be using models in different context right and we are seeing this more and more with llms that were initially released as these sort of like chat Bots and chat agents and they have just grown to be so much more than that like I'm see LMS being used um for like Robotics and for like um for for language instructions for solving like programming problems math and all of that so what happens if you have like an llm that generates bad code or like broken code or like you know deploy has some security vulnerability that no one notices and these are all problems that are really really challenging and I think these can happen through like both like yeah so obviously you have data poisoning you also have people like adversly prompting uh and prompt engineering these llms to produce that kind of stuff um and I think these kind of attacks are just like um really really problematic what to do to stop them I think is just like being really really careful and having like a system of checks and balances in order to like make sure that your model is outputting what you want it to output and I think that recent advances in like tackling these sort of issues are like really really exciting to read about so you have like um you obviously have like manual filters or like you know so like the most primitive form ofage is like certain phrases or certain proms that just block from like occuring but I think that like fine tuning models on specific", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 20211, "end_char_idx":

well as like reinforcement learning from Human feedback where like a human is in the loop and is trying to like tell the model like oh this is a good output this is a bad output like those kind of like sort of intensive work being done on the model can help it prevent from like and specifically speaking to large language models can help it prevent from like prevent the model from generating this kind of text so I think that um personally that like um yeah we're going to see a lot of like like adversarial attacks are now part of our reality and like we are going to see a lot of them and I think that mitigation techniques are just going to evolve with them so it's going to be like um the old cyber security versus like hacker um like sort of dynamic where every new exploit needs a batch and then every new batch can like lead to a new exploit potentially and someone needs to check that and so I think we're going to see a lot of that in the AI world as well true another example could be like you know in your training set someone can add a stop light a stop sign as a green light you know if it's a self-driving car so you know these are very dangerous any other dangers you've seen I think a fun one was uh when a checkered car like a car with a checkered and so it was not even being identified as another car it was being identified as like an object that's completely unrelated and I think that's like a dangerous example of like why how like you know if you're not really really not careful about your data you can um you can end up with misclassification issues I think another fun one was I think if you add some noise to the image of a band there were some um image like classification models that identified a panda as a given and um I think that while you know the day-to-day dangers of misclassifying a panda are not that severe I think that some poor Wildlife um Enthusiast is going to be very very sad um with that happening so yeah I think that there's there's definitely interesting like sort of issues around that and um yeah mitigation is just going to be a challenge coming going forward into like the future years let's come back to MIT MIT doing everything amazing in the era of innovation for example you are up to date in your classwork from gpt3 till now what has happened you are up to date from Transformers from the first research paper that came out in the in in the era of llms that was you know attention is all you need so these are things that other universities not just in other countries like Africa India or China but even in the US I if I go to even like you know Georgia state Georgia Tech ASU they are they also take longer than my team to stay updated they also sometimes are not up to date they just say yeah ke go to go to corsera study from there they are not at at the speed of MIT so what are the things that student can do to match the level of Excellence of MIT sure um I think that like on on the first point I think um yes it takes time for things to come into coursework I think that's just the progress of science so um I think we're going to see more and more of like um I think in a world where we have digital learning like as a possibility we're going to see a lot more of people incorporating like all sorts of digital articles research papers you know Cutting Edge development into their curriculum and I think that um this is something that's just going to keep growing so I think that the way things are today may not be the way things are you know even four years into the future where people going into college today are going to be graduating so I think there's a lot of potential like sort of um like I have a lot of excitement around like more and more like sort of you know reagin

reimagining of the curriculum as it exists so we're going to see like a lot of exciting engineering discoveries being talked about in the classroom and so that's personally something that's very exciting for me um I think for students I think that the general thing that helped me was uh so MIT also puts a lot of his cours work online on open courseware um so it's ocw.mit.edu there's a lot of like helpful stuff from our classes from our ranging from like lecture videos to lecture notes to like textbook recommendations and stuff so I think that um if you want like an education like where you are sort of like pursuing all the stem stuff that like you know other students at other universities are pursuing honestly the easiest way is just to like look up what people are talking about at the in that course or what other the topics that are being covered in those courses so you can just search those topics up yourself and like read about more about them so I think um I think one of the best ways that I sort of like learned about different topics at Mid was just looking like finding something that a professor like randomly mentioned in a class or something and being like oh that sounds really interesting and then I go back and then I'm looking up like what is this about and then before I know I'm on some like lecture slide from some other university and I'm just reading about that particular like Niche topic and I think that sort of learning is really really helpful it helps you discover like a lot of different things going on not only in computer science but in other fields as well um it also helps you like understand the history of what's going on in your classes so like especially in like at least I can only speak to computer science and math which is sort of the the majors that I pursued at MIT but in my um in my classes a lot of things I feel were like better contextualized I understood why it's important to study them and like why we got to this point where we are talking about this in the classroom because not all papers and not all like key ideas sort of make it into textbooks or or discussed there's just too much research going on and there's a lot going on right so understanding where this came from and what the field was like when this idea was published and how it changed the field is like really really exciting to learn about so I think that's something that um you know is amazing and I think for courses in general I think pursuing courses were your like sort of instructor is like um sort of like this is their passion this is their course like you know is is something is amazing I had the privilege to take like classes where which was basically like what you would call as someone's specialty so the instructor had basically done like years of research on this one topic they were teaching like a specific um like sort of uh insight into their like how do you get introduced to that kind of work or how do you get introduced to that kind of research and so they have all these cool ideas and these cool tidbits that they will mention in class where uh you know you're just learning about what is new in the field what has been some new development in the field and because they're up to date on the literature is really exciting to learn that so I feel like for every University obviously has like different like sort of people with different specializations and people whose research interest are very different but taking classes where the specialization and the professor's like own research field sort of like intersect with this course material is like super super rewarding in my opinion so I think that was just amazing so yeah so so you mentioned for students they can start with mit's course workor they can continue to learn whatever whatever information that is new in that cour work explore go in depth into it now how can institutions can get better can can be at the level of MIT I think that generally I think so

they're up to date on the literature is really exciting to learn that so I feel like for every University obviously has like different like sort of people with different specializations and people whose research interest are very different but taking classes where the specialization and the professor's like own research field sort of like intersect with this course material is like super super rewarding in my opinion so I think that was just amazing so yeah so so you mentioned for students they can start with mit's course workor they can continue to learn whatever whatever information that is new in that cour work explore go in depth into it now how can institutions can get better can can be at the level of MIT I think that generally I think so there are a few things that institutions can do which I think were like sort of like the most like rewarding aspects of my undergraduate experience I think the the the most rewarding experience by far that M provided was something called the undergraduate research opportunities program um I participated in it every single semester of my time at MIT I was just constantly like working with someone or the other on some project um and I think that was really really cool because a lot of like a lot of research work that you get exposed to is often not research work that you just like stumble across one day right it's it's because someone talks to you about it it's because someone like gives you like sort of some some sort of mentorship and like some sort of help in terms of how do you get introduced to the field and I think that the mentors and the the research opportunities that I had at MIT were fantastic I think that the people who supported me here were like amazing and they provided very thorough like sort of explanations and introductions to like their particular specialization and I think that just having that sort of like close like one-on-one time with an individual mentor and individual researcher is like so so helpful and I think that um more universities should have such kind of opportunities for undergraduate research I love to see like you know like there there are like whole like nowadays there are like whole conferences dedicated to undergraduate research and just undergraduate research and that's really really exciting for me to see because that is what shaped most of my ID experience so I think that's the by far the biggest one um I think in terms of Education I also think that like having sort of these there's so many like sort of optional classes and electives at Mid that are just you know super cool and just like super exciting to think about so when you're flipping through the course catalog you you really are spoiled for choice or like oh I want to take this class I want to take that class this class is only being offered this one like sort of like once every two years or so and it's being taught by someone who's like absolutely like you know the last four papers they published were on this topic right so I think that like really tying like classes together with people's specializations is like really what makes like a department like you know feel like home to the students like feel where students get excited about the classes that they're taking because I think that um I I think that in general like taking these kind of classes or offering these kind of classes is very very cool um and also I think updating them frequently is also like super important like I've seen classes that have like you know that were taught one way when I started at MIT and by that now that I'm graduating and watching other people take this class it's totally different like I can't even recognize it and that's sort of like even within four years that level of like drastic change is like um I think it just speaks to like how how passionate sometimes like professors are about like teaching students like what's new in the curriculum like what's new in research and I think that's like super um just just super amazing in general like I think that it like yeah that that sort of dedication and that sort of like passion is just um you know it makes students feel excited about the subject and at least like many people I know who did undergraduate research did it because they were interested in a topic because a professor like talked about it in a class and they went up to the professor afterwards and they talked to the professor about that topic and like ended up like doing a research on that topic like that is something that happens way more often um than you would think it does and like and it's just so amazing to see yeah totally agree the earlier you start the better you become I can I can totally say that people who are starting now at sixth grade into AI seventh grade it might be funny for some people but they are becoming better AI researchers there are there surely like a pattern people who start early are becoming better Engineers people are becoming better AI researchers programmers Engineers now you're going for your PhD can you share what are the futures of job in the world of AI you see around you yeah sure um so yeah so I think um I think that AI is definitely like", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 32103, "end_char_idx": 37388, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}",

you're going for your PhD can you share what are the futures of job in the world of AI you see around you yeah sure um so yeah so I think um I think that AI is definitely like I've seen a lot of people like working at AI companies and a lot of like uh new postings for AI researchers and AI scientists and um just I think there's a lot of potential and that the field is really growing I think personally for me I think um so some of the different ways I've seen people get involved is often you can like have like a machine learning internship at a startup where you're basically just building out their pipeline um for solving like a particular machine learning problems I think those are like some of the internships you'll see uh like being posted a lot I think more more and more companies have dedicated like machine learning Engineers who are working on like massive systems that already exist in the company and they're improving efficiency they're improving speed they're improving performance and all of those things are like really really like exciting because you're tackling machine learning from like a systems perspective you're tackling it from a hardware perspective you're tackling it from like really really lowlevel like um code perspective so it's really really exciting to like look at someone approach machine learning from all these different angles right so all of these different positions are dropping up um I think that um there's also more interest in like having dedicated like ml research scientist teams who are working on like Innovations in areas where um you know like particular companies are really really interested in so you now you have people with image teams you have um sort of multimodal like Vision text teams you have all these sort of research teams that like you know even a few years ago like the postings for that were like very very few and now like a lot of Industries are really excited about machine learning and they're trying to um hire a lot of good like um individuals who are like interested in working in those areas so in General I think that um I think that like in general there are a lot of opportunities in machine learning I think that um well yeah I think the PHD aspect of it is just like I think yeah that that that's not something I can really speak to because I I haven't finished right I haven't looked at the PHD postings in too much detail yet so I feel like that's just a yeah yeah jobs are popping crazy but the difficult part is people are choosing AI Engineers who just learned how to train train an llm in 2023 2024 over someone who has an llm experience of 2016 that is how fast it is changing you you you said it right and your PhD degree right now or your MIT degree right now or your knowledge right now is more important than someone's machine learning knowledge 5 years ago it's that crazy and you're right that we have to every single year there's no there's no shortcut to hard work you have to have to show experience which is the latest right you agree I think um yeah I think um well I will say that like some amount of like longevity in the field is important like um I think a lot of um experienced like researchers in AI are finding a lot of renewed interest in their works so I think that being in AI for a long period of time is definitely like helpful but um with that being said I I just think there's generally just more openings in general which are hiring for like different levels of experience so I think that for certain like roles um employers don't really like see um having a PhD as that necessary for what they're trying to do and what kind of models they're trying to build whereas um in other kind of roles they're just looking to like open up teams and like have like research scientists lead those teams so I think you know I really think that it's just like whatever fits for the company and whatever works for the company um in Kashi so yeah do you think we're going to go into the future of more tokens being processed because it's impossible for example Gemini introduced their 2 million token window 2 million to token context that means you can put 10 python libraries that a human cannot learn in a in months or years you", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 36333, "end_char_idx": 41452, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}",

million to token context that means you can put 10 python libraries that a human cannot learn in a in months or years you canar learn in one minute using those those context Windows do you believe future is even bigger I think that yeah we're definitely going to see like bigger more and more context Windows like I think a lot of exciting research is going on in that area um I also think that like we are also seeing interesting research in the other direction which is what you want to shrink your models so that they run locally on your phone on your laptop and stuff like that so I think that a lot of research is also going into like figuring out what how how to make models work well and those those context so I think you know I think there are many different ways machine learning as a field is evolving and I think those are really exciting so yeah sure and last any final advice scho student he like you know treats you as a wants toer the world so first of all but follow your passions definitely pursue it as much as you can school school whatever opportunities you getting like learn more about science learn as much as you can and participate in competitions where like um you know you get to do research you get to do projects you get to like show like your science knowledge and like share science with the rest of the world and I think that in and out of itself College like satisfy um and I think another piece of go on go on like search like enrichment opportunities online and stem enrichment opportunties sumam summer camps and often times like you know they don't even have like Financial cost is like a barrier pursue these kind of opportunities as much as you can there are olympiads in linguistics and philosophy which are like becoming more and more popular nowadays and India sending teams there so like participa in those kind of competitions and it's yeah it's just you know just enjoy your high school like your middle school and high school years in general like colleges look for like across the board they look for um like passion and dedication to your subject though a specific College I'm not to say this so and totally starting early is important age is not a barrier age barri alcohol but not for learning you can learn as early as possible absolutely yeah awesome thank you so much sagnik it was wonderful talking to you got so many insights into the into the era of AI Innovation that I had never heard about learned so much and I going to do my homework going deeper into your learnings and thank you so much again", "mimetype":
