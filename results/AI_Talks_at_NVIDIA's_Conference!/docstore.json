It's not expected This is not my channel But I have hacked channel of Harnoor/SinghinUSA Now you'll say why I did it! I just his 2-4 videos I'll tell you everything You'll get to know such things in the video Here we go Here are many booths That is Anthropic Here is so much food guys Amazing! So, clerk has an integration with visionPro Bro its fully packed! So Hi guys, Right now We're at Stripe session We got to see the session of CEO of Invidia Jensen Huang and Arvind Srinivasan from Perplexity Getting to speak to him and see him here was Unbelievable! I haven't hacked his channel I'm making a video. I got a chance and I'm here at Stripe sessions conference where I met Harnoor. We met each other and felt very good. My name is harry, You must have seen me on Code with harry channel. I'm a software developer and I make videos on youtube One of the most indepth videos I've ever seen Let's start firstly about AI Jensen Huang said that the people and companies who won't use AI They'll have almost 5-10x less growth. Acc to you, How much % of your job has been taken by AI? And how much you think it's gonna continue Firstly I'm thankful that Harnoor invited me on his channel and that intro was just a joke Don't cut 50rs for overacting but coming to the point what Harnoor asked that will AI eat your job? If you've seen me before then I always say no and what we heard now from Jansen Huang and he told things just like Harnoor told you where he said that you'll not be replaced by AI but There are two big innovations in AI, No.1 is ChatGPT No.2 Llama 3 He just said that it got breakthrough from Llama 2 only. Because of Llama 2 and 3, Generative AI has reached massive no. of people. So you tell me, what'll be benefit from Llama 2 and 3? I'll tell you, See I'll just tell you Jansen words He said that ChatGPT reached to all people To marketers and software developers Almost to everyone But Llama 2 did a new thing Those people who were not using chatGPT Maybe they didn't want their data to be stolen Even sometimes I used to think that I am using company's data So they used to say that don't put in ChatGPT What Llama did was, They did it open source They said that Before it was, ChatGPT on server of open AI You're sending request from here and all data is going to open AI. Open AI knows what you're doing But what will happen with Llama 2 is Something like chatGPT running on your server It was powerful enough Llama 3 has better results than even GPT3.5 And it is offline in that And for copilot people used to pay $10/month They beat that also Now it is free You also made Yes I have Yes, I have watched it It was very nice Talking about Llama 3 It changed industry because because before employees of many companies used to feel jealous that this employee is allowed to use chatGPT but us We had security code but we couldn't put But with Llama 3, A privacy layer came It got offline No copilot needed Don't have to pay $10/month to companies. And that just changed the game for developers. Now it is so much accesible to developers. Correct, Even Jansen said this thing Jansen also said it, I completely agree And it got very smooth with coming of Llama 3 and with open source models. Now there's pressure even on open AI that they release their open source model Like google pay is doing with open source model. So, this wave of open source models That was started by facebook with Llama 2 and Llama 3 And their biggest competition is that who'll buy more GPU of Invidia Introduction was very good, they talked about their GU H100. Meta CEO is taking more Elon Musk is taking more Jansen Huang spoke about future of AGI Artificial general intelligence. So first of all, if we want to define You define first, How you'll say What is AGI? And I want to add it because AGI is getting better everyday A said definition of AGI means I mean, people have defined I'll tell you what Jensen Huang said We both heard the talk some time back In that they said that define a particular problem that AI will do AI will definitely do it.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4143, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b578cf5-a8de-4200-be3f-b2ebb6d76a4b": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b578cf5-a8de-4200-be3f-b2ebb6d76a4b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/youtube/AI_Talks_at_NVIDIA's_Conference!.txt", "file_name": "AI_Talks_at_NVIDIA's_Conference!.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 11647, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "65783c14-678a-45b5-8964-26077968e860", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/youtube/AI_Talks_at_NVIDIA's_Conference!.txt", "file_name": "AI_Talks_at_NVIDIA's_Conference!.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 11647, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-11"}, "hash": "54bc4da98da79d822b3b0b3a33587092bf249f3c1511d4eef627343bcd5d1c54", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5dc82124-5524-4fbc-ad35-5ecae7290218", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/youtube/AI_Talks_at_NVIDIA's_Conference!.txt", "file_name": "AI_Talks_at_NVIDIA's_Conference!.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 11647, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-11"}, "hash": "3bea56f0331c348a3d1cf5dd8811c16afa4c0eb9a68f79905e5feff049fdc90a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e939f657-0f51-449e-8a6f-163d32f4e428", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f0aa89ccfd9925c546bfc4613fd6d68c1e5348824ef2b26e21059db2fae85894", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Now there's pressure even on open AI that they release their open source model Like google pay is doing with open source model.

So first of all, if we want to define You define first, How you'll say What is AGI? And I want to add it because AGI is getting better everyday A said definition of AGI means I mean, people have defined I'll tell you what Jensen Huang said We both heard the talk some time back In that they said that define a particular problem that AI will do AI will definitely do it. If not today then definitely in next 5 years. It's not like him. We can joke as well We can also tell that How's San Francisco He can tell you that What you have to do to come in US I can tell you what's in New Delhi I mean, he can also tell but You've to give particular problem to AI And train on that problem and AI will do it That's what they said You tell what's your definition of AGI AI will be capable of doing it. But on this thing, I'll say that That atleast for next 5-7 years which I'm saying that is valid That's what I thnk Otherwise, what someone will do in one month we don't know Alright That's what it is Basically AGI is, how fast our kinda intelligence can reach to it General thinks the same way we think But Jansen Huang said If you define that If you can think like an english teacher That chatGPT can also do So, by saying that I got so shocked that I also got shocked to hear that When they made us realize this thing If you get to listen that talk then must listen The way he said The way he explained that AGI didn't came, that all are saying But if you define a particular problem and after that you define AGI according to that Like, now he said about english speaking that you want to learn english speaking ChatGPT will teach you If chatGP is also less You train another model and then see the capabilities Today we talk about 7 billion parameter Those 7 billion parameters are handling Even if you talk about chatGPT knows coding, cooking knows where to wander in san francisko Also knows what's in New delhi It also knows what's in my city and his city. Just try and train the 7 billion model in a particular problem You'll be shocked Exactly! that Which model is better? Like he told me in the talk today that The whole game changes For example: If you have knowledge We train its data whose accuracy is 99%. Train data of my knowledge which is 98%. So, if you combine both is not better. Keep both separately The reason he said that was that if you are training english model Do it separate separate for spanish, hindi and punjabi. I want to say is, if two people have different knowledge They model gets trained and there'll be lots of arguments. So implement them parallely and use them separately they should use Llama as well chatGPT also There is meta also. So if someone wants to produce then use all four I use perplexity also. Now I'll add a point on this If you are doing any particular work We use 90% chatGPT for coding only Exactly! So, I know which AI I want to use Like when I use Llama I made a video on that as well I use code Llama in that because I have tested it I have tested myself I'd say that you test it for your own use case that you get better results in Llama or which model You're getting from chatGPT, Llama3 or Llama 4 There are many different models So, from which you're getting and use it according to that What's performing best for your use case Use that model Exactly! You have to do multiple use for best accuracy that if two people are trained with different knowledge Output of both can be completely different Both can have complete different output because we both have different experience which Jansen Huang spoke about I wish you having all the pains in life. Let said one line, let me recall it that I will torture you to excellence Absolutely true passion is not something that your everyday goes in fun. He said that I want you to feel the torture to excellence. So you also feel that you've also made a unicorn He said that So later in life you see yourself doing something good.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3304, "end_char_idx": 7706, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e939f657-0f51-449e-8a6f-163d32f4e428": {"__data__": {"id_": "e939f657-0f51-449e-8a6f-163d32f4e428", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/youtube/AI_Talks_at_NVIDIA's_Conference!.txt", "file_name": "AI_Talks_at_NVIDIA's_Conference!.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 11647, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "65783c14-678a-45b5-8964-26077968e860", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/youtube/AI_Talks_at_NVIDIA's_Conference!.txt", "file_name": "AI_Talks_at_NVIDIA's_Conference!.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 11647, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-11"}, "hash": "54bc4da98da79d822b3b0b3a33587092bf249f3c1511d4eef627343bcd5d1c54", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b578cf5-a8de-4200-be3f-b2ebb6d76a4b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/youtube/AI_Talks_at_NVIDIA's_Conference!.txt", "file_name": "AI_Talks_at_NVIDIA's_Conference!.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 11647, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-11"}, "hash": "c1b558c436cd4434a9006c0a5cb59e7dabb34c9901cd348c1acd423de97c1b68", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "58fa4958-a48a-4e29-8093-4f0f0c381169", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "706f32d2130e5afb7fc0c525dd3715d67768aa29a1dbb10ab6e00c29a7e9af8f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "You have to do multiple use for best accuracy that if two people are trained with different knowledge Output of both can be completely different Both can have complete different output because we both have different experience which Jansen Huang spoke about I wish you having all the pains in life.

Exactly That's how he said Had lots of goosebumbs on it On this, tell the students as they are choosing their passion now There are lots of things I'll tell you on this I believe that if you're in college Alright People talk many things People tell to start business or startups, Many things are going in market I'm like, you see your success first Everyone have their next level It can be next level for someone For someone, next level can be Whatever is your enxt level If you're in college then it might be In whichever college you're If you're in IIT You know google and microsoft are coming And if you know your CGPA is capable if they're asking for DSA. If they start asking from tomorrow There only you'll get the experience. There only you'll get to know many things This is how it works I'm not saying only job. whichever is your next level. You reach that next level. Like if you know with web development, you may get internships This is what I'll see for now Don't think of too far Don't think of making a billion dollar company I've seen small kids that we want to make billion dollar company. Atleast pass semester's exam first Rightly said because Shouldn't decide present by thinking of future Now there are jobs of web development Currently most jobs are of web developmet and then data science. Prepare for them No one knwos what's gonna happen in future See job portal and wherever are the jobs Prepare for that I think he's secretely promoting surf excel. He said it 2-3 times. What you think, Before you see any channel of DSA That was very booming chatGPT has killed that What you think how much value DSA plays in your life? See, if I tell you truth There's been very less role of DSA in my journey. That doesn't means people shouldn't do DSA. I think people should do DSA. People do it very aggresively It also has many variations If you're sitting to see If you'll just see DSA codes then you'll miss many codes. like we were talking about Llama 2. YOu don't understand why Llama 2 is important If you'll give whole time to DSA when you'll do the rest You must go little into web development also Atleast you should know how websites work people don't even know about server You must also know You don't know client server And you're saying I know all questions We don't need to become a machine Because we have machine ChatGPT You're right that DSA is only needed to a limit I've 4 years of experience in software engineering I have not used link list Neither I made arrays from scratch Used all DSA concepts for understanding only Never had to use from scratch Right! If I ever did then I did for video only. that web development has got very saturated. You made video on this On that some people say that like how you'll enter into tech industry Acc to me, if you see what AI can do You'll decide on basis of AI capabilities then you won't be able to do anything So if you'll think this then you'll never be able to grow I'll say don't think so much I mean, what's visible now What's visible that's what I am saying He's also saying what he knows No one knows what will happen after 10 years Exactly! We don't know what will happen in 10 years No one knew chatGPT will come We're saying all acc. to our understanding only If I tell you about my understanding Now AI lacks creativity I feel that I mean there's not much creativity Like the way we vlog We did vlogging and I show you around like here is this and that with jokes Take this video as example Can AI make this video?
